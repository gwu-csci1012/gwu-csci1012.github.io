title: "CS 1012: Introduction to Programming with Python"
---

### Welcome to CSCI 1012 - Spring 2024:

- **General information**: The course we will meet during lecture and laboratory times each week.
    - Most of our communication to you will be by Blackboard messaging and announcements.
    - Start by reading the [About](about.qmd) section. 

- **Getting Started**: You will need to install a Python IDE or Integrated development environment.
    - Follow the instructions on [Installing an Editor](units/unit0/editor.qmd).
    - Choose Thonny (for [Mac](units/unit0/guides/thonny-mac.qmd) or [Windows](units/unit0/guides/thonny-windows.qmd)) as your primary choice of IDE for its simplicity, especially if you are new to coding. However, you can choose, Spyder (for [Mac](units/unit0/guides/anaconda-mac.qmd) or [Windows](units/unit0/guides/anaconda-windows.qmd)) which is a more versatile alternative. 

- **Course schedule**: The [Schedule](schedule.qmd) page outlines the weekly-schedule and what your deliverables are. It is YOUR job to keep to the schedule and submit work accordingly.
    - The first meeting of the course will be during the labs on Wednesday (01/17/2024) and Friday (01/19/2024) [See [Schedule](schedule.qmd)]
    - Note that there is deliverable by January  22, 2024 by 11:59 PM.

- **Submitting your work**: When you submit work, please follow the specific instructions outlined on [how to submit your work](submit-remember.qmd).

- **Main method of communication during the semester**: Our main method of communication is Ed, an online discussion board for questions and answers related to the course, whether technical or logistical in nature.
    - [Join Ed here](https://edstem.org/us/join/aNhz9P)
    - Do not post your source code to Ed. 
    - Think through your questions. Post a general of the programming concept. 
    - Your questions on Ed will be addressed within 24 hours.

- **Communication during extenuating circumstances**: When you need to communicate with us directly regarding extenuating circumstances, please use Blackboard or follow the specific instructions outlined in [Blackboard](https://blackboard.gwu.edu).
    - The instructor will check emails on Mondays and may respond directly or have one of the GTAs respond. 
    - Any direct email communication with the instruction team may not result in a response.

- Our staff is limiting the use of Linux OS-based laptops and cannot support them this year. 
- We prefer that your computer has a standard US keyboard layout i.e, a QWERTY keyboard. 
- The QWERTY (pronounced KWEHR-tee) keyboard is the standard typewriter and computer keyboard in countries that use a Latin-based alphabet.
