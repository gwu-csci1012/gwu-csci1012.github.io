title: "What to remember about submitting work"

## Most important

- The submission requirements are <em>stringent</em>. You MUST name folders and files exactly as described.
- Your programs must do what's asked, no less no more. If you print more than what's required the <em>autograder</em> will not grade your program.

If you've forgotten how to make folders, zip files etc, now may be a good time to [**review your computerese skills**](./units/unit0/guides/computerese.qmd)

## Correct folder structure on your laptop
For the overall class you should have a folder named `cs1012` on your computer:

- You can create one such folder on your Desktop, but you could also place this inside some other folder.

:::{.callout-warning}
It's all lowercase, with no spaces.
:::

In the cs1012 folder, create a folder for each unit. Eventually, you will create a folder for each unit and each module in a given unit.  

You must name your folders with the following rules:

- There will be 3 units, so you will ultimately have folders called `unit0, unit1` and `unit2` inside your cs1012 folder.
- Name the unit folders carefully:
    - For your **Unit 0** work, name that unit's folder `unit0`.
    - For your **Unit 1** work, name that unit's folder `unit1`.
    - For your **Unit 2** work, name that unit's folder `unit2`.

- Each unit has several modules. For each module folder inside the each unit folder, you must name the module folder according to these rules: 
    - For your **Module 0** work, name that module's folder `module0`.
    - For your **Module 1** work, name that module's folder `module1`.
    - And so on.

    - Inside each module folder you must save the appropriate python scripts (`.py` files) that you would write throughout your cs1012 journey.

- Each unit has will also have assignments. For each assignment make a folder in the **cs1012** folder. You must name the assignment folders according to these rules: 
    - For your **Assignment 0** work, name that folder `assignment0`.
    - For your **Assignment 1** work, name that folder `assignment1`.
    - And so on if there are more assignments.

- Thus, one looks inside your **cs1012** folder, we'd expect to see 8 sub-folders called `unit0, unit1, unit2, assignment 0, assignment 1, assignment 2, assignment 3` and `assignment 4`. 
- And, if one further looks inside the `unit0` folder, we'd expect to see 7 sub-folders:
    - 7 of these will be called `module0, module1, module2, module3, module4, module5` and `module6`
    
## Correct location and naming of files within folders
Every module and every assignment will feature multiple files:

- Most files will be Python programs. The names of these will end in `.py`.
- For example: `myname.py`.
- Another example from Module 0  in Unit 0: In Exercise 0.4, you are instructed to create the files `error1.py` and `error2.py`. These need to be saved in your `module0` folder when using your code editor (_Thonny_ or _Spyder_).

## Making a zip to submit
When you zip your files when preparing to submit them, you must zip only the files for the current module and you must name the zip file for the corresponding folder.  

- The easy way to do this is to zip the folder containing the files.  
- When it's time to submit, you will upload this zip file (example: `module1.zip`) into the _appropriate place in Blackboard_.
- Be careful to avoid spaces where they shouldn't be spaces, and to use <em>lowercase</em> when asked. For example:
    - `module0.zip` (correct)
    - `Module0.zip` (wrong: starts with uppercase)
    - `module 0.zip` (wrong: space before 0)
    - `module0.docx` (wrong: not a zip).
