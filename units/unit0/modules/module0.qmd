Unit 0 > Module 0

## Objectives
By the end of this module you will be able to:
- Experince writing a really simple program.
- Explain the difference between command-line outputs vs GUI for programs.

### 0.0: Our First Program
Lets take a look at our first program as it appears in a textbook (like this one):
```python
print("Hello World")
```

This is a simple program written in the Python programming language, possibly one of the smallest programs one can write, and a traditional starting point for learning programming.

We will very soon (below) write this program ourselves.

For now, let's point out a few things:

- What we see above is the _text_ of the program.
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module0/firstprogram.png)
- The entire program will appear inside of a _code editor_ when we write.
- We could use one of several code editors.
- For example, this is how it would look inside the _Spyder_ code editor:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module0/spyder.png)
- And how it might look in the _Thonny_ code editor:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module0/thonny1.png)
- Various editors colorize in different ways for convenience of reading, none of which affect the actual text of the program.
- Apart from typing it in (which you'll do shortly), we haven't actually _run_ the program.
- Intuitively, just looking at the program we might think that:
    - It has to do with some kind of "printing" (because we see `print`)
    - We have no idea what is meant by the somewhat odd phrase "Hello World!", but we see it there.

- There are several ways to run a program:
    - Run the program inside the very same editor used to type in the program.
    - Run it without any editor (a slightly advanced topic).

- For example, if we run the program using the _Thonny_ editor, we will see this:

Next, you will try this yourself.

So, what's with printing the unusual phrase "Hello World!"?

- It's a tradition in computer science that your first program will print "Hello World!".
- It's meant to pretend that a program is a creature that's itself communicating to the outside world by saying hello.

### 0.1 The recipe-cook-dish analogy

What just happened above?

Let's use an analogy
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module0/recipe.png)
    
- A recipe is a bunch of instructions in text form.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;
A program is also a set of instructions in text form.

- By itself, a recipe doesn't do anything until it's _acted on_.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;
You can type up a program but not do anything with it (i.e., not run it).

- A cook _executes_ a recipe by following the instructions
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;
A combination of elements in your laptop _executes_ a program.

- The net result of a cook executing a recipe is, typically, a dish.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;
The result of executing a program is the program's output

- We of course design and write up programs to get useful or interesting output.

- When a recipe is poorly written, or if the cook messes up, the result may be failure.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;
A program and the laptop are even more exacting: the slightest error can result in failure.

### 0.2 Programming vs. computerese

What we mean by _computerese_:

- The computer-related tasks and knowledge that are needed, but not the intellectual core of programming.
- We use the term slightly pejoratively, like _legalese_.
     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr; 
     A necessary evil.

- Examples of computerese:
     - Navigating directories
     - Locating files, copying them, moving them.
     - Mastery of editor keys, shortcuts.
     - Handling the quirks of an operating system.
     - Uploading files to a website, downloading.
