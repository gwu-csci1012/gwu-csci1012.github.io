## Objectives and example
Assignments are designed to strengthen your problem-solving skills and build <em>independence</em>. While the module exercises are small variations of explained module examples, a single assignment will have multiple problems, all of which are intended to be more challenging than the module exercises, and will feature less detailed guidance. This is a good thing because ultimately, you'll have to solve problems on your own. Facing and overcoming challenging problems cheerfully is the key to building problem-solving skill.

In each such assignment set, we will help develop your problem-solving skills by showing you how to solve one problem, the first and often hardest problem. <em>However, the solution will include some exercises for you that you will need to submit</em>.


## Assignment problems

### 1. Demo problem
Suppose we want to use for-loops to produce this arrow-head like pattern:
```python
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
********
*********
**********
**********
*********
********
*******
******
*****
****
***
**
*
```
At this point, do not read further and try to address the following:

- First understand what is being asked.
- Do you see a for-loop or two at work where, as the loops are printing, you'll get the output shown above?
- Can the problem be broken down into parts, where you can solve the parts and put the solution together afterwards?
- Try writing some code to get at least some of the output.

[**Now examine the solution**](./assignment0-solution.qmd)

Don't forget to submit your solutions to the exercises within.

### 2. In `my_nested.py` use nested loops in print the following pattern:
```python
1  1
2  1
3  1
4  1
1  2
2  2
3  2
4  2
1  3
2  3
3  3
4  3
1  4
2  4
3  4
4  4
```

### 3. In `my_nested2.py`, write a program that uses nested for-loops to print the following pattern:
```python
* * * * * * * * * * 10
  * * * * * * * * * 9
    * * * * * * * * 8
      * * * * * * * 7
        * * * * * * 6
          * * * * * 5
            * * * * 4
              * * * 3
                * * 2
                  * 1
```

Notice the spaces between asterisks, the spaces leading up to the first asterisk in each line, and the number at the end.

### 4. In this exercise you will use a drawing tool and a for-loop to draw a series of rectangles. The goal is to draw this:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/assignment1/rectangles.png)

The code for drawing a single rectangle is:
```python
from drawtool import DrawTool 

dt = DrawTool()
dt.set_XY_range(0,100, 0,100)

dt.draw_rectangle(10, 20, 5, 10)

dt.display()
```
This produces (we've added some markup to explain):

<!-- ![]() -->

As a first step, download <a href="../../../media/useful/drawtool.py" download>**drawtool.py**</a> into your assignment1 folder and type up the above single-rectangle example in `my_rectangle_example.py`. This way, you know that the download worked and that drawing works. Now you can focus on the many-rectangle problem. Think about how the for-loop needs to range so that you can draw the rectangles in the loop. Write your program in `my_rectangle_pattern.py`.

### 5. The following program intends to print 
  ```python
hello
how're
you?
```
This is the alleged program:
```python
print('hello")
print('how're')
print('you?)
```
There are several errors above. Point them out in your assignment pdf. Then fix them in `fixed_hello.py`.

### 6. The following program intends to print the following five times as in:
  ```python
xyz
xyz
xyz
xyz
xyz
```

This is the alleged program:
```python
Def print_one_line():
for i in range(1,5):
    print(xyz)

print_one_line
```

There are several errors above. Point them out in your assignment pdf. Then fix them in `fixed_xyz.py`.


### 7. The following program intends to print the numbers 5 through 0 as in:
```python
5
4
3
2
1
0
```
This is the alleged program:
```python
def function#2()
    for i in range(5,-1, 0):
        print(i)

function#2()
```
There are several errors above. Point them out in your assignment pdf. Then fix them in `fixed_downprint.py`.

<!-- ### 8. In each assignment, we will include a sometimes whimsical, sometimes serious non-coding exploration to encourage creativity and curiousity. For this assignment, in your `assignment1.pdf`, make a cartoon that makes light of "frustration with computers". You can use a simple drawing tool, or find images that are copyright-free (please include the link to images/cartoons). Make sure the caption is <em>original</em> (this is the whole point). We'll post some of the funniest ones. -->


## How to submit:

<!-- - Write all your programs and `assignment1.pdf` in a directory called `assignment1`. -->
- Make a zip of the directory and submit that.
