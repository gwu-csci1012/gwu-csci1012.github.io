## Objectives
As usual, in each such assignment set, we will help develop your problem-solving skills by showing you how to solve one problem, the first and often hardest problem. <em>However, the solution will include some exercises for you that you will need to submit</em>.


## Assignment problems

### 1. Demo problem.

Consider this coding puzzle. Suppose we're asked to print out lines in a pattern like this:
```python
z
zy
zyx
zyxw
zyxwv
zyxwvu
zyxwvut
zyxwvuts
zyxwvutsr
zyxwvutsrq
```
And suppose we want to use for-loops to achieve this. How do we go about solving this problem?

At this point, do not read further and try to address the following:

- First understand what is being asked.
- Do see a for-loop or two at work where, as the loops are printing, you'll get the output shown above?
- Can the problem be broken down into parts, where you can solve the parts and put the solution together afterwards?
- Try writing some code to get at least some of the output.
- What are the issues related to strings?

[**Now examine the solution**](./assignment1-solution.qmd)

::: {.callout-caution collapse="false"}
###### <span style="color:#8B4513;">You are required to submit your solutions to the **exercises** within this demo problem.</span>
Don't forget to submit your solutions to the exercises within the demo problem while you are being asked to examine the solution through the guided exercises presented to you [**here**](./assignment1-solution.qmd).
:::


### 2. Write a program to compute the sum of all odd and even numbers in a given range. Here's part of the code:

You need to submit the following programs: 

#### **2.1 Initialize m = 10 and n = 20 and compute the sum of odd and even numbers within that range in a program called `my_oddeven_sum1.py` using one for-loop.**

- Your python program should include the following comments 

    ```python
    m = 10
    n = 20

    # Code to add up the even and odd numbers between m and n
    # using one for-loop 
    # WRITE CODE BELOW THIS COMMENT




    # WRITE CODE ABOVE THIS COMMENT
    # When m=10, and n=20, 
    # the sum of even numbers is 70 and 
    # the sum of odd numbers is 75.
    ```
- Your output should look like how it is shown below:

    ```python
    10 10 11 11
    12 22 13 24
    14 36 15 39
    16 52 17 56
    18 70 19 75
    ```

**Now examine the output**

![](../../../media/units/unit0/assignment1/Assignment_Problem2ai.png)

:::{.callout-tip}
<!-- ![](Assignment1_DemoPic1.png) -->
- Notice that the first column has even numbers between 10 and 20 and not including 20. 
     - The second column has the cumulative sum of the even numbers. When m=10, and n=20, the sum of the first two even numbers is 22, the first three even numbers is 36 and so on until the sum of all even numbers within the range is 70. 
- The third column has odd numbers between 10 and 20. 
    - Similarly, when m=10, and n=20, the sum of all odd numbers within that range is 75.
:::

#### **2.2 Now create a similar program with m=100 and and n=200 and save it as `my_oddeven_sum2.py`.** 

#### **2.3 Finally, create one more program with m=1000 and and n=2000 and save it as `my_oddeven_sum3.py`.** 

:::{.callout-warning}
You will be submitting the following three programs in this assignment exercise: 

1. `my_oddeven_sum1.py`
2. `my_oddeven_sum2.py`
3. `my_oddeven_sum3.py`
:::

### 3. Review the examples in `Module 5` where we made random sentences. After pulling out random nouns, a verb etc, we built a sentences using the (incomplete) code below:
```python
import wordtool

# Write some code to invoke functions in wordtool to pick random words 
# See examples in module-5 is find those functions and implement them here

name = input('Enter your name: ')
sentence = (
    'Hi ' + name + ', you are a '+ adj + ' ' + noun + ' ' +'that ' + verb + 's' +
    ' ' + prep + ' a ' + noun2 + '.')
```
You need to fix the above code and submit the following programs: 

#### **3.1 Create a program `my_avg_SentenceAdj_length1.py` that** 
- implements a for-loop and builds 10 sentences. 
- prints each sentence 
- computes the average sentence length and average adjective length and 
- prints the two averages at the end.

:::{.callout-tip}
You should use the sentence construction shown in the incomplete sample code above. Notice that the sample code also has an `input()` function asking the user's name. Note that the sentences constructed using the sample code above will include spaces that will be counted in the sentence length.
:::

#### **3.2 Create a program `my_avg_SentenceAdj_length2.py`that has the same requirements as exercise 3.1 but with 100 sentences.**

#### **3.3 Create a program `my_avg_SentenceAdj_length3.py`that has the same requirements as exercise 3.1 but with 1000 sentences.**

:::{.callout-warning}
You will be submitting the following three programs in this assignment exercise: 

1. `my_avg_SentenceAdj_length1.py`
2. `my_avg_SentenceAdj_length2.py`
3. `my_avg_SentenceAdj_length3.py`
:::

### 4. Use the sample code provided below and write up a python program `my_geometric_art1.py` and submit it.
Here's some code to get started with:
```python
import tkinter as tk
import random as rand

window = tk.Tk()
w = 500
h = 400
canvas = tk.Canvas(master=window, width=w, height=h)
canvas.pack()

# A function that draws a random circle
def draw_random_circle(color):
    x = rand.randint(0, w)
    y = rand.randint(0, h)
    size = rand.randint(0, w/10)
    canvas.create_oval(x,y, x+size, y+size, fill=color)

# WRITE YOUR FUNCTION TO DRAW A RANDOM RECTANGLE HERE. 
# Name the function, draw_random_rectangle(color)

# draw N circles
# 
N = 10
for i in range(N):
    draw_random_circle("magenta")

# Standard colors: "black", "red", "green", "blue", 
# "cyan", "yellow", "magenta"

window.mainloop()
```
The program will generate an image with 10 circle, filled with magenta color as shown below:

![](../../../media/units/unit0/assignment1/artwork1.png)

:::{.callout-tip}
You may refer section 2.3 in `module 2` to understand how the program `my_geometric_art1.py` is executed
:::

#### **4.1 Writing a function `draw_random_rectangle(color)` in the above program and save it as `my_geometric_art2.py`** 
- `draw_random_rectangle(color)`should that the following expressions
    
    ```python
    # A function that draws a random rectangle

    def draw_random_rectangle(color):
        x = # A random top left x-coordinate of the rectangle
        y = # A random top left y-coordinate of the rectangle
        h_dist = # A random horizontal distance of the rectangle
        v_dist = # A random vertical distance of the rectangle
        canvas.create_rectangle(x, y, h_dist, v_dist, outline=color)
    ```

- `my_geometric_art2.py` should generate 10 circles filled with magenta color and 10 rectangles with red outline and not filled with any color as shown in the example image below:

![](../../../media/units/unit0/assignment1/artwork2.png)

:::{.callout-tip}
You may refer section 3.6 in `module 3` to understand how the function `canvas.create_rectangle()` draws a rectangle. 
:::

<!-- Start by downloading <a href="../../../media/useful/drawtool.py" download>**drawtool.py**</a> into your assignment folder. Then, write the above code in `my_geometric_art.py` to see that a part of the drawing has been made for you. You can draw a circle with center at (10,20) with radius 5 using the line:
```python
dt.draw_circle(10, 20, 5)
```
(Try it). -->

#### **4.2 Art project**
In `my_geometric_art3.py`, use the ability to draw rectangles and circles, changing colors where needed, to make a far more impressive work of art. 

- `my_geometric_art3.py` should output an image with 100 filled, circles in cyan color and 100 rectangles, not-filled and outlined in red color

#### **4.3 Art project**
In `my_geometric_art4.py`, use the ability to draw rectangles and circles, changing colors where needed, to make a far more impressive work of art. 

- `my_geometric_art3.py` should output an image with 1000 filled, circles in green color and 100 rectangles, not-filled and outlined in blue color


<!-- You are also welcome to use other functions in drawtool such as:
```python
dt.draw_filled_circle(10, 20, 5)
dt.draw_filled_rectangle(40, 50, 5, 5)
``` -->
:::{.callout-note}
With a limited color and geometric palette, we're confident you can make something [Mark Rothko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko) or [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) would be proud of.
:::

:::{.callout-warning}
You will be submitting the following four programs in this assignment exercise: 

1. `my_geometric_art1.py`
2. `my_geometric_art2.py`
3. `my_geometric_art3.py`
4. `my_geometric_art4.py`
:::

### 5. The following program intends to print the integer value of a letter (character) along with the corresponding letter, separately for uppercase first, and then lowercase. The output (edited for length) is something like:
```python
65-A
66-B
67-C
...
90-Z
97-a
98-b
99-c
...
122-z
```
Here's the program with errors:
```python
for i in range(65,91):
    print(i+ "-" + chr(i)

for j in range(ord('a'),ord('z')):
    x = char(j)
    print(str(i)+ "-" + x)
```
Find and fix the errors in above program to match the output shown in this exercise. Save the program as `fixed_errors1.py` and submit it.
