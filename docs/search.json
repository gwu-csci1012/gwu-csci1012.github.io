First, we could have named our for-loop variable\nfor count in range(6):\n    print(count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt’s customary to use short variable names like i and j\n\n\n2.

We don’t have to increment the for-loop variable by 1.\nfor i in range(10, 16, 2):\n    print(i)\n\nThis prints the numbers 10, 12, 14.\nThe number 2 in range(10, 16, 2) specifies an increment amount.\nThus, we start with i taking the value 10 in the first iteration.\nIn the second iteration, i becomes 12 (because 10+2 = 12).\nIn the third iteration, i becomes 14 (incrementing 12 by 2).\nIf we were to increment 14 by 2 it becomes 16 which is past the last value allowed.\nImportant: think of 16 as “the variable cannot have this value or anything past this value”.\n\n4. We can decrement, as in:\nfor i in range(16, 10, -1):\n    print(i)\n\nThis will print 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11.\nWe start with 16 (the first part of the range).\nAfter each iteration we apply the increment/decrement amount.\nIn this case, applying -1 to 16 gives us 15, which gets printed.\nThen, the third time through, i becomes 14. And so on.\nIn the last iteration, i becomes 11.\nFinally, when i is decremented to 10, the loop is ended.\n\n\n3.6 Excercise: Type up the above four examples in my_forloop_variation1.py, my_forloop_variation2.py, my_forloop_variation3.py, and my_forloop_variation4.py.

    "text": "3.3 Tracing through a program in detail\nWe’ll now look at an example of how to execute a program “by hand”. That is, how to trace a program’s execution by painstakingly following its execution step-by-step.\nAt first this will appear tedious, but it is critical to a firm understanding of how programs execute, and eventually to your own writing of programs.\nWe’ll first do a longer, more narrative version here, and then show you how to submit a much shorter version for your exercises.\nFor our example, let’s look at the program we last saw:\nprint(1)                   \n\nfor j in range(2, 5):      \n    for i in range(j):     \n        print(j, end='')\n    print()    \nLet’s now dive into the longer version, just for the sake of understanding.\nTo make best use of this:\n\nOpen this same page in another browser, and have the program side-by-side, as you read what’s below.\nRead out aloud what you see below.\n\nReady? Let’s trace through: \n\nRight at the start, the first line is print(1). This prints out 1, and moves to the next line. \nInitially j=2 at the start of the outer for-loop: \nSince j is 2, it’s within the range, and we enter the outer for-loop.\n\nNow we encounter the inner for-loop, where i is set to 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nwhen range has only one number specified, it’s understood to be the upper limit.\n\n\nThe upper limit is the current value of j, which is 2. \nInside the inner loop, we execute print(1), which, because j is now 2, will print 2. \nWe’re at the end of the inner loop, so now i increments to 1: \nSo now inside the inner-loop, we print 2 again \nThen, at the end of the inner for-loop, we return to the top where i increments to 2.\nSince i is at the limit, we exit the inner for-loop. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe inner loop iterated twice.\n\n\n\nNext, we go past the inner loop to print(), which goes to the beginning of the next line. \nThis completes the first iteration of the outer, after which we go to the top of the outerloop and increment j. \nExecution now enters the outerloop with j set to 3.\n\nNow we encounter the inner for-loop, where i is set to 0\nThe upper limit is the current value of j, which is 3.\nSo, the inner loop executes three times, with i first set to 0, then to 1, then to 2.\nThis will result in printing three 3’s.\nWhen i becomes 3, it hits the inner-loop limit and proceeds to the print() that follows.\nThe output so far is:\n\n\n1\n2 2\n3 3 3\n\nThis completes the iterations of the inner loop with the outer loop j set to 3.\nNext, j becomes 4 \n\nThe inner loop starts with i set to 0.\nEach time through i increments.\nUntil i hits the limit j (which is 4 now).\nThis results in four 4’s being printed in a line.\nThen we come out of the inner loop and execute print(), which goes to the next line.\n\nThe output so far is\n1\n2 2\n3 3 3\n4 4 4 4\nFinally at the end of the outer loop, j becomes 5 and hits the limit of the outer loop \n\nYes, that was long. But doing this many times will help you understand how to read programs. Later, you will become good at this and will, with a quick glance at the inner-loop, say “Oh, this prints 2 twice in the first iteration of the outer.”\nImportant: when you need to submit a program’s traced-out execution, use a shorter version. For example, see this PDF for the above program.\n\n3.14 Excercise: Consider this program:\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    for j in range(i, 0, -1):\n        print('*', end='')\n    print(' ', end='')\n    for j in range(1, i):\n        print('-', end='')\n    print()\n\n\nFirst, trace through the values of i and j by hand and try to figure out what gets printed. Do this painstakingly for each possible value of i and j, remembering that i is now the name of the outerloop variable. Write your tracing in module3.pdf, using the shorter “table” format we saw in see this PDF for the above program earlier. Then, edit, compile and execute the above program in my_forloop_trace.py.to see if you were right.\n\n\n\n3.16 Excercise: Consider this program:\nWrite a program to print out consecutive integers in a diagonal, as in\n1\n 2\n  3\n   4\n    5\nUse a nested for-loop as in earlier examples to print the requisite number of spaces before printing a digit. Write your code in my_diagonal_print.py.\n\n\n3.17 Excercise: Consider this program:\nWrite a program to print out\nI'm feeling cold: b rrrrrr rrrrr rrrr rrr rr r\nUse a regular print to print everything up to the b. Then, use a nested for-loop for the r’s. Don’t forget the space between each grouping of r’s. Write your code in my_brr_print.py."

    "text": "3.7    Some things to keep mind\nLet’s introduce the notion of reserved words:\n\nSome words like for and in are special to the language and are called reserved words or key words of the language. \nThere are special rules associated with the usage of such reserved words, which we’ll describe over time. For now, we’re just pointing them out.\nAnother example of a reserved word we’ve seen: def\nIt turns out that, even though print looks like it should be a reserved word, it’s in fact not.\n\nAt this stage, the distinction is not clear and that’s fine.\nAs you learn the language, you’ll learn how to distinguish.\n\n\nCounting from 0:\n\nWhen a single number like 6 is specified in the range as in range(6) \nThus, i is 0 the first time, then 1, then 2, and so on until i = 5 (last time through).\nThe number 6 specifies that i cannot be 6 or higher.\nThus, there is a certain strangeness to get used to:\n\nUnlike math (where counting starts from 1), in programming, the convention is to start from 0.  (Did you notice that’s why we started with Module 0?)\nThe other strangeness is specifying the limit as one higher (6) than than last iteration value (5).\n\n\nThe different uses of range\n\nWhen a single number is specified, as in range(6) the implied start is 0.\nWhen two numbers are specified as in: range(10, 16) the first is the start of the count, and the second is the limit: \n\nThus i is 10 the first time (this is the first thing that’s printed).\nThen i becomes 11.\nThen 12, and so on until the last time through when i is 15.\n\nWhen three numbers are specified as in range(10, 16, 2) the third number is the increment. \n\nHere, i starts as 10 in the first iteration.\nThen, i is 12 in the second iteration.\nThen i becomes 14. This is the last iteration because after that i would be 16, which ends the loop.\n\nUsing range(10, 15, 2) produces the same result as above, and in fact preferable.\n\nAbout comments:\n\nFirst, comments are for us to read. The computer does not read them.\nThus, in terms of execution, this program\n\n# list the even numbers between 10 and 14, inclusive:\nfor i in range(10, 15, 2):    # Notice the increment\n    print(i)\nwill result in the exact output as this one:\nfor i in range(10, 15, 2):\n    print(i)\n\nWe will use comments in two ways, as in the above example:\n\nThe first comment is an example of using a comment as a prelude to code, to explain what’s coming or intended.\nThe second kind that is to the right side of a line of code is like an alert: we’ll use this to point out something to pay attention to in that line of code."

Save the file in the module0 folder as myname.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the future we will be asking you to “type up” programs; in all such cases, please also save the file (for eventual submission)\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4 What happens when things go (even slightly) wrong\nWe’ll now deliberately make a few tiny errors and see what happens:\n\nError #1: forgetting to type the closing parenthesis.\n\nHere’s the program:\n\nprint('Hello World!'\nNote the missing right parenthesis at the end of the line.\n\nWhat happens when we nonetheless try and run the program?\n\nHere’s an example with the Thonny editor: \n\nError #2: What happens if we forget the quotation marks?\n\nHere’s the program:\n\nprint(Hello World!)\n\nWe get something quite similar: \n\n\n\n0.4 Excercise: Confirm that you get the errors above by typing up the two programs as error1.py and save the programs in the module0 folder.\n\n\n\n0.5 A peek at a more complex program\nJust to see what’s coming later, let’s get a sense of what a more complex program looks like.\nYour goal is to look through it with bemused curiosity, as if studying an incomprensible work of abstract art.\nWe’ll just examine the some surface features, as we would when examining some undeciphered ancient script such as: \nLet’s start by running the program.\n\n0.5 Excercise: Download whackamole.py into your module0.py folder Then open it and run it. You should see\n The purpose of the program and how you use it should be easy to figure out.\nLet’s point out a few things:\n\nUnlike the toy helloworld.py example, this program actually does something nontrivial.\nThe program brings up a window, and allows a user to interact with it (the program).\n\nNow let’s list the program and then point out some “surface” features.\nThe full program:\n# whackamole with nerf gun\n\n# Use programs written by others through \"import\"\nimport tkinter as tk  \n\n# Define a window\nwindow = tk.Tk()\n\n# The instructions at the top\ninstructions = 'Click reset, then click fire to strike the mole'\nlabel = tk.Label(text=instructions)\nlabel.pack()\n\n# Build a rectangular space on which to draw \n# shapes like circles\nw = 300\nh = 200\ncanvas = tk.Canvas(master=window, width=w, height=h)\ncanvas.pack()\n\n# These are variables that control the \n# position of the target and nerf ball\ntargetX = 0\ntargetVX = 10\nnerfX = 0\nnerfY = h-10\nnerfVX = 20\nnerfVY = 0\nnerfAY = -3\ndelT = 0.1\nnerfFired = False\n\n\n# This is what we want to do when the \n# reset button is clicked:\ndef reset():\n    global nerfFired, targetX, nerfX, nerfY, nerfVY\n    nerfFired = False\n    targetX = 0\n    nerfX = 0\n    nerfY = h-1\n    nerfVY = 0\n    canvas.delete(\"all\")\n    print('reset')\n\n# When the fire button is clicked, we change \n# the status of the nerf gun\ndef fire():\n    # start launch\n    global nerfFired\n    nerfFired = True\n    print('fired')\n\n# Build the three buttons called \"reset\", \"fire\" and \"quit\"\nframe = tk.Frame(master=window)\nframe.pack()\n\nresetb = tk.Button(\n    master=frame, text=\"reset\", relief=tk.RIDGE, \n    fg='black', bg='grey', height=2, width=5,command=reset)\nresetb.grid(row=0, column=0)\n\nfireb = tk.Button(\n    master=frame, text=\"fire\", relief=tk.RIDGE, \n    fg='black', bg='grey', height=2, width=5, command=fire)\nfireb.grid(row=0, column=1)\n\nquitb = tk.Button(\n    master=frame, text=\"quit\", relief=tk.RIDGE, fg='black', \n    bg='grey', height=2, width=5, command=window.destroy)\nquitb.grid(row=0, column=2)\n\n# This part of the code draws and animates\ndef run():\n    global targetX, nerfX, nerfVY, nerfY\n    canvas.delete(\"all\")\n    targetX += targetVX * delT\n    canvas.create_rectangle(\n        targetX, h-10, targetX+10, h, fill=\"green\")\n    if nerfFired:\n        nerfX += nerfVX * delT\n        nerfVY += nerfAY * delT\n        nerfY += nerfVY * delT\n    canvas.create_oval(\n        nerfX+5,h-nerfY+5, nerfX+15, h-nerfY+15, \n        fill=\"red\")\n    window.after(1, run)\n\n# Launch the window and start the animation\nwindow.after(1, run)\nwindow.mainloop()\nYes, that’s a long program! Now let’s point out some features:\nFirst, some features from the first half of the program: \nAnd some from the latter part:And some from the latter part: \n\n\n\n0.6 GUI vs command-line\nGUI stands for: Graphical User Interface.\nAnd is pronounced like “gooey”.\nThe difference between GUI and command-line programs:\n\nPrograms like helloworld.py from earlier printed plain text. These are Command-line programs.\nPrograms like whackamole.py bring up their own little window on your screen. These are called GUI programs.\nGUI programs are typically more complicated because one has to specify all the elements (buttons etc) of the interface.\nWe will spend quite a bit of time learning programming with simpler (albeit less exciting) command-line programs.\nHowever, we will occasionally work with GUI programs because they are visually more interesting, and demonstrate applications.\n\n\n\n0.8 Computer science: beyond programming\nIs computer science the same as programming?\nNot at all:\nProgramming is certainly a significant part, just as narrative non-fiction is a significant part of an English degree.        ⇒ But there’s much more to it.\nWhat else does a computer science degree feature? Typically:\n\nProgramming devices (units 9-10).\nAn understanding of the hardware (units 11-12).\nAlgorithms: the science in computer science.\nTheory: understanding fundamental theoretical limitations of computation.\nA deeper understanding of how computer systems work: networks, databases, operating systems.\n\nBut also electives among (to name a few):\n\nArtificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, natural language processing.\nDesign of interfaces.\nGraphics, animation, visualization.\nDigital humanities, computing for arts and social sciences.\nScientific computing.\nComputational X, where X=biology, physics, economics …\nEducational tools, health data systems.\nMedical devices, prosthetics, control of mechanical systems\n\n\n\n0.8 How to succeed as a student\nThe challenge in learning programming:\n1: it’s an alien world.        ⇒ Takes getting used to.\n2: it’s a mental skill        ⇒ Skills are acquired slowly, with much practice, and in fits and starts.\n3: there are confounding issues        ⇒ some knowledge of (regrettably) computerese needed.\n4: it’s easy to feel overwhelmed or intimidated        ⇒ your neighbor may appear to be “getting it” while you feel you don’t.\nWhat you should expect:\n\nYou can’t learn instantly        ⇒ You may have to see a concept multiple times to “get it”.\nYou may occasionally feel bewildered.\nThere are some things that can’t be understoodat this stage.        ⇒ Not enough background.\nIt’s deceptively easy to understand an idea when reading or viewing but devilishly harder to do it yourself.\n\nHow to succeed:\n\nMake progress every day        ⇒ Each module builds on previous modules        ⇒ Can’t afford to let anything slide.\nBe willing to put the effort        ⇒ Do all exercises, assignments etc.\nPractice being irrepressibly positive.\n\n\n0.6 Excercise: Create a PDF file (using Word, Google-docs, or anything like that) called module0.pdf in your module0.pdf folder. This document should contain: (1) a picture that says something about you (it need not be a picture of you, it could represent something iconic for you.) (2) a paragraph about yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhat to rememeber about submitting work\n\n\n Next Module: Module 1"

What is the output?\nAbout concatenation:\n\nThe same + that we used for integer addition is what’s used to concatenate strings.\nThus multiple-usage of symbols in a programming language is common: we’ll see other examples of a single symbol or function serving multiple purposes.\n\nHow come Python doesn’t get confused and think that x, y, z are integers wanting to be added?\nPython is smart about context, and understands that when + is used with strings, the only reasonable thing to do is to concatenate. Likewise, with numbers, Python will add them.\n\nYou may have noticed the words all strung together without a space. So let’s add the spaces:\n\nx = 'Sphinx'\ny = 'of'\nz = 'black'\n\ns = x + ' ' + y + ' ' + z + ' quartz, judge my vow'\nprint(s)\n\nprint(len(s))\n\nNotice how multiple strings, some from variables, and some just written into the statement, are concatenated: \n\n\n\n5.3 Excercise: Type up the above in my_string_example3.py.

    "text": "5.2 Fun with string concatenation\nWe will occasionally introduce programs we’ve written to both simplify your programming and yet allow for interesting examples.\nIf all we did was compute with integers, it would be boring.\nYou’ve already seen one example of such a tool: drawtool.\nWe’ll now use wordtool, another tool that you will use by calling appropriate functions.\nYou are welcome and are encouraged to “look inside” by skimming over the code in any tool.\nLet’s look at an example that will also introduce some new ideas:\nimport wordtool\n\n# Invoke functions in wordtool to pick random words:\nadj = wordtool.get_random_adjective()\nnoun = wordtool.get_random_noun()\nnoun2 = wordtool.get_random_noun()\nverb = wordtool.get_random_verb()\nprep = wordtool.get_random_preposition()\n\n# Build a sentence with these random words:\nsentence = (\n    'The ' + adj + ' ' + noun + ' ' + verb + 's' +\n    ' ' + prep + ' a ' + noun2)\nprint(sentence)\n\n5.7 Excercise: Type up the above in my_random_sentence.py. Don’t run it just yet. First download wordtool.py and wordsWithPOS.txt into the same folder as your program. Now run the program several times. Report your favorite output sentence in module5.pdf.\nLet’s point out:\n\nwordtool.py is merely another Python program, like the ones you’ve been writing, just a bit more complex.\nwordsWithPOS.txt is plain text data (about English words, and parts-of-speech).\nwordtool.py is written to read the data and make some functionality available, one of which is to randomly pick words from amongst the nouns, adjectives, and so on.\nTo use functions in wordtool.py in your program, you need (and this is a new thing we’ve introduced) the import statement at the top of your program:\n\nimport wordtool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe .py part is not in the import statement\n\n\n\nThen, to use a function defined in that other file, we use syntax like this:\n\nadj = wordtool.get_random_adjective()\n\n\nHere, adj is a string variable that we made.\nThe combination of wordtool, a period, and the desired function get_random_adjective(), is what’s needed to invoke that particular function.\nIn this case, it results in a randomly selected adjective (from the thousands in the data) being copied into the adj variable.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, after getting a random noun, verb, and so on, we put those together to make a sentence. Hopefully, with hilarious results.\nWe’ll point out one other new thing:\n\nsentence = (\n    'The ' + adj + ' ' + noun + ' ' + verb + 's' +\n    ' ' + prep + ' a ' + noun2)\n\n\nHere, we are concatenating many strings into a long one.\nHowever, if it’s unwieldy to type them all in one line, we can spill over into multiple lines.\nOne way to do that is to use parentheses as shown above.\n\n\n\n\n5.8 Excercise: Open wordtool.py and examine the functions within. Then, make a longer random sentence in my_random_sentence2.py."

This string is displayed as a prompt in the output:\nEnter your name: \nOf course, you aren’t writing this tiny program to send to someone who will run your program and type in their name. You are playing both roles: programmer and intended user.\nWhatever the user types in (from the keyboard) becomes a single string that’s placed in the variable we’ve called name\nThen, we’ve concatenated whatever gets into namewith two other strings and printed the result:\nprint('Hi ' + &lt;b&gt;name&lt;/b&gt; + '!')\n\n\n\nNext, let’s make it more interesting:\nimport wordtool\n\nname = input('Enter your name: ')\n\nprint('Hi ' + name + '!')\n\nadv = wordtool.get_random_adverb()\nadj = wordtool.get_random_adjective()\nsentence = name + ', you are ' + adv + ' ' + adj\nprint(sentence)\n\n\n5.11 Excercise: Improve on the above program by writing your version of a longer conversation my_random_conversation2.py. Allow the user to type in something at least three or four times. This will require using input multiple times to go back and forth with the user. Unleash your guile and creativity.\n\n\n5.12 Excercise: Try out a conversation with a chatbot. For example, one of the earliest chatbots in history was Eliza, which you can try out.

Then confirm the final output in your trace by typing it up in my_loop_example.py. Then change the value of n to 8 and examine the output. Submit your program with n set to 8.\nNext, let’s use a nested loop to output a triangle of asterisks:\nn = 5\ns = ''\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    for j in range(0, i):\n        s = s + '*'\n    s = s + '\\n'\n\nprint('A triangle with base=' + str(n))\nprint(s)\n\n\n5.14 Excercise: Before typing up the program, trace the execution of the loop, showing the contents of the string s in each iteration of the outer for-loop.

    "text": "5.6 Variable names\nMost often, we’ve been using single letter variable names, for example:\ni = 7\nj = 15 * i\nprint(j)\n\nx = 'Hello' \ny = 'World'\nz = x + ' ' + y\nprint(z)\nLet’s rewrite the above with more meaningful variable names:\ndays_in_a_week = 7\ndays_in_a_semester = 15 * days_in_a_week\nprint(days_in_a_semester)\n\nfirst_greeting_word = 'Hello' \nsecond_greeting_word= 'World'\nfull_greeting = first_greeting_word + ' ' + second_greeting_word\nprint(full_greeting)\nAbout variable names:\n\nFirst, let’s review the very notion of a name in Python, along with other kinds of “words” that are allowed in Python programs.\nReserved words or keywords:\n\nSome words in the language belong formally to the language itself.\nThese are words like for, in, def, and others.\nIn fact, just to complete this, here’s the full set of 33 reserved words:\n\nand as assert break class continue def del elif else except False finally for from global if import in is lambda None nonlocal not or pass raise return True try while with yield\n\nEveryone of these must be used in very specific ways, in statements or in more complex structures.\nWe will learn more about these as we proceed in the course.\nWe won’t learn about all of them, because full mastery of the language takes more than one course.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, there are words that we freely create for our use, as in these examples:\n\ndef print_hello():\n    print('Hello')\n\nprint_hello()\n\nx = 'How goes?'\nprint(x)\n\nfor i in range(1,10):\n    print(i)\n\n\nHere, we made a function and decided to call it print_hello\nWe decided to call the string variable x\nAnd to call the loop variable i\nThese are called identifiers (jargon alert).\n\n\n\nSince we get to choose them, we could rewrite the above program as:\n\ndef say_greeting():\n  print('Hello')\n\nsay_greeting()\n\nfollow_up = 'How goes?'\nprint(follow_up)\n\nfor my_loop_variable in range(1,10):\n    print(my_loop_variable)\n\nSo, what should dictate our choice of these names?\n\nGenerally, for numbers, loop-variables and short calculations, we prefer single-letter names like x and i.\nFunction names should carry some meaning so that anyone else who needs to use them should be able to make sense of them.\nSometimes, variable names should be longer when we want the code to be readable long after it’s written.\nFor example, it would not make sense for Python to use cryptic_blob_42 instead of print.\n\nThe use of underscores:\n\nYou’ve noticed by now the presence of underscores in our variable and function names.\nAn underscore is a convenient visual aid to help us read.\nWriting days_in_a_week is better than daysinaweek because it’s easier to see.\nImportant: we cannot use spaces, so days in a week would be incorrect as a variable name.\n\nGenerally, we shouldn’t go overboard and make unnecessarily long names either, as in the_number_of_days_in_a_week.\nAnother important rule: use only letters, digits and underscores, and always start with a letter. Do NOT use other symbols like % or $ in variable names.\nFinally, there are some function and variable names “already taken”. That is we can’t use them (or shouldn’t) because Python has decided to use them.\n\nFor example: print is a function name.\nAs are chr and ord and various math functions.\nWhile we could technically use these names, we should avoid the conflict because it breaks convention and can cause hard-to-find problems.\n\nHere is a list of “avoid” names:\n\nabs, all, any, ascii, bin, bool, bytearray, bytes, callable, chr, classmethod, compile, complex, delattr, dict, dir, divmod, enumerate, eval, exec, filter, float, format, frozenset, getattr, globals, hasattr, hash, help, hex, id, input, int, isinstance, issubclass, iter, len, list, locals, map, max, memoryview, min, next, object, oct, open, ord, pow, print, property, range, repr, reversed, round, set, setattr, slice, sorted, str, sum, super, tuple, type, vars, zip\n\nDo NOT use these as your own variable or function names.\n\n\n5.24 Excercise: Let’s see what can go wrong if we use one of the words “already taken”. Consider this program:\ns = 'Hello'\nlen = 5       # This is a BAD idea\nprint(len)\nWe really should not be using a variable called len since len is a predefined “already taken” name. What happens if you type and run this? Type your program in my_variable_name3.py.Then, type this program in my_variable_name4.py:\ns = 'Hello'\nlen = 5       # This is a BAD idea\nprint(len)\n\nt = 'Some looooooong sentence'\nk = len(t)\nprint(k)\nWhat do you see?

    "section": "5.7 A problem solving example",
    "text": "5.7 A problem solving example\nPossibly the hardest aspect of programming is problem-solving:\n\nTypically, we’re given an English description of a problem, with the goal of writing a program to solve the problem.\nThe hard part is not the typing, and remembering syntactic details like parentheses.\nThe hard part is figuring out what to write in code to solve the problem.\n\nLet’s work through an example problem and solve it.\nBefore that, we’ll learn one more string function:\ns = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'\nn = s.count('a')     # How many a's occur in the string s?\nprint(n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve introduced a new feature of strings: the ability to count occurences of a letter in that string.\nNotice the unusual way by which the function must be used:\nn = s.count('a')\nand NOT\nn = count(s, 'a')\nThat is, the function count appears to be part of the string variable s.\nThis is a somewhat advanced topic, so we’ll just use it and be glad we have this feature. (There are other such functions we’ll avail of.)\nThis is possible for any string, such as:\nx = 'helloooooooo'\nprint(x.count('o'))    # Number of o's in string x\ny = 'missisippi'\nprint(y.count('i'))    # Number of i's in string x\n\n\n\n\n5.26 Excercise: Confirm by typing up the above in my_letter_count.py.\nOK, now the problem:\n\nA pangram is an English sentence that contains all 26 letters.\nWe’ve already seen two examples:\n\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\nSphinx of black quartz, judge my vow\n\nThere’s an informal competition running over a hundred years to find the shortest grammatically correct English sentence that’s a pangram.\nOur smaller problem: given a sentence, print the number of a’s, the number of b’s … and so on. This could be useful in judging such a competition.\n\nLet’s work towards a solution:\n\nGiven a candidate pangram, we could count the number of a’s:\n\ns = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'\nprint(s.count('a'))\n\nThen, we could also count the number of b’s:\n\ns = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'\nprint(s.count('a'))\nprint(s.count('b'))\n\nIf we repeated this 26 times, we’d have a count for each letter.\nBut the moment we see a bunch of repetition, our computational problem-solving instincts (yes, still developing) should kick in:\n\nRepetition ⇒ use a loop!\n\nWhat is the nature of iteration in this problem?  We are iterating through the letters ‘a’ to ‘z’\nAnd we already know how to iterate over the letters:\n\nfor i in range(97, 123):\n  letter = chr(i)       \n  # Recall: We're going from Ascii code to letter\n\nCould we combine this with the counting of occurences inside the given string? So, the idea would be:\n\nfor i in range(97, 123):\n  letter = chr(i)       \n  # Now somehow use that to do the counting of occurences\n\nCombining:\n\ns = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'\n\nfor i in range(97, 123):\n  letter = chr(i)       \n  k = s.count(letter)\n  print('Number of occurrences of ' + letter + ' is ' + str(k))\n\n\n5.27 Excercise: Type up the above idea my_count_problem.py. Then, find another pangram and apply the program to that pangram. Submit your program with the pangram shown above (not the one you found).\n\n\n5.28 Excercise: This can be taken a step further. Instead of typing the pangram in the program itself (as was done above), ask the user to enter it as input. In my_count_problem2.py, read a string from the user and print the letter counts. When you test your program, use the pangram you found as input.\nLastly, we’ll point out a slightly more elegant way of iterating over the 26 letters:\nascii_a = ord('a')\nascii_z = ord('z')\nfor i in range(ascii_a, ascii_z + 1):\n    letter = chr(i)       \n    # Now somehow use that to do the counting of occurences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nInstead of typing in the numbers 97 and 123 (which we’d have to remember), we’re instead using the ord function itself to identify the limits of the loop.\nAn even more (but harder to read) compact way is to write:\nfor i in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n    letter = chr(i)       \nWe’ll understand this better once we see functions in more detail.\n\n\n\nFinally, we’ve written a program to solve an actual problem. Perhaps there’s a market out there for pangram-checkers?"

    "text": "6.0 What are real numbers?\nLet’s start with some math facts:\n\nWhole numbers like 3, 42 and 1024 are integers.  (As an aside: integers include 0 and the negative ones like -2 or -219).\nThe collection of all integers is infinite in size.\nBut integers are limited because some operations on integers do not yield integers:\n\n30 ÷ 5 gives 6, which is an integer.\nBut 31 ÷ 5 is not an integer, yet it’s a quantity.\n\nReal numbers include all the integers but also numbers like 3.141, and -615.2368.\nThe collection of all real numbers is also infinite. Interestingly, it’s a bigger kind of infinite (but that’s a rather subtle math argument outside the scope of this course).\nThe term real is just that: a term that’s came about historically to describe all these numbers.\nYou might wonder: is there any other kind of number?\nTurns out: yes, there a fascinating (and extraordinarily useful) kind of number called an imaginary number, or more generally, a complex number.  (We won’t be working with these in his course.)\nWhat does one do with real numbers?\n\nThe same operations: +, -, *, /\nWhat’s nice is that applying these to real numbers will always result in real number results.\n\nFor example:\n\nx = 3.14\ny = 2.718\nz = x + y\nprint(z)\n\nw = z * (x + y) / (x - y)\nprint(w)\n\n6.1 Excercise: Type up the above in my_real_example1.py. What is the output?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nYou might have seen 5.8580000000000005 as the value of z printed out.\nHowever, you might also have seen something slightly different because of the approximate nature of such calculations, a limitation of computer hardware.\nThese tiny errors are tiny indeed, but vary slightly from one computer to another, generally occuring around the 16th decimal place: 0.00000000000000001\nDo we need to worry about this? Only if we are engaged in complex scientific calculations.\nOccasionally, however, it can matter. For example, if two people calculate mortgage interest (with real consequences) slightly differently, it could lead to a legal conflict.\n\n\n\nQuick review of some relevant math:\n\nOne kind of operation that’s useful is power.\nWe write 26 to mean 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (six times)\nIt’s easy to see that you could make this work for real numbers that get multiplied: 2.566 = 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56\nBut could you do 26.4? Turns out, yes, you can do this even if it’s not easy to see or intuit. (We would expect 26.4 to be larger than 26 and smaller than 27, which it is.)\nThe next step then is to allow numbers like 2.566.4.\nIn fact, you can take any real number as the mantissa (the 2.56 in 2.566.4) and any real number as the exponent (the 6.4 in 2.566.4).\nLet’s put this in code and introduce a new operator to raise a number to a power, as in 2.566.4).\n\nx = 2 ** 6\nprint(x)\n\ny = 2.56 ** 6.4\nprint(y)\n\n\n6.2 Excercise: Type up the above in my_real_example2.py. What is the output? Consider 2.56x = y. Can you guess what approximate value of x would make y become 400? Play around with the number 6.4 in the program above and see if you can guess approximately what value would make y become 400. \nLet’s explore further:\n\nThe technical term for “what is x that would make 2.56x = 400?” is logarithm.\nWe would say: x = log2.56(400).  (Read this as: x is equal to log of 400 to the base 2.56).\nWe can calculate this directly:\n\nimport math\n\nx = math.log(400, 2.56)\nprint(x)\n\nHere we’ve introduced some new concepts: \nJust like you can ask Python to calculate logarithms using math.log, you can do other kinds of “calculator” functions conveniently.\nExample: math.sqrt for square roots.\n\n\n\n6.3 Excercise: In my_real_example3.py, fill in code below\nimport math\n\n# Write a line of code here\n\nprint(x)\nto compute the square root of 2 and print the square root (and only the square root - just one number)."

None of this will be on any exam.\nLet’s start with numbers:\n\nThe easiest kind of number to understand are the natural numbers.\n\nThey are the numbers 1, 2, 3 … and so on.\nIt’s an infinite set, and many operations like + and * applied to naturals result in a natural.\nBut 3 - 5 is not a natural number, and neither is \\[ \\frac{3}{5} \\].\nSo, they’re limited in their use.\n\nIf we expand the naturals and add 0, and all the negative numbers, we get \\[\n          \\ldots -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \\ldots\n  \\] (The triple-dot that indicates “going on forever” occurs now on both sides, the positive side and the negative side.)\n\nHowever, they too are limited because neither \\[ \\frac{3}{5} \\] nor \\[ \\frac{5}{3} \\] are integers.\n\nThe next kind of number to consider is rational number:\n\nA rational is a number that can be written as a fraction (or ratio) of integers.\nExamples: \\[ \\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{46}{7} \\]\nThey include all the integers.\n\nThen we get to the real numbers introduced in this module.\nWithin the real numbers there are interesting categories.\nSome real numbers are irrational and cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers.\n\nOne example is \\[ \\sqrt{2} \\], which bedeviled the Greeks a long time ago.\nInterestingly, one can prove that there are many more irrational real numbers than rational real numbers.\n\nAnother kind of real number is an algebraic number, meaning they are the solution to an equation like \\[ 3x^2 + 5 = 11 \\]\nThose that aren’t algebraic go by the lovely name of transcendental number, such as \\[ pi \\]\nSo, is every number a real number?        ⇒ No, there are numbers like \\[ \\sqrt-1 \\] that are imaginary.\nYou might think that an imaginary number couldn’t possibly have any use. It turns out that they are extraordinarily useful in many kinds of practical applications.\n\nExample: processing any kind of “wave” data, such as brain waves or seismic waves.\nExample: quantum computing.\n\n\nSome ideas to reflect on:\n\nWhich of the following most resonates with you?\n\n“I’ve always found math very hard and prefer to avoid it.”\n“I can tolerate math but would rather avoid it if possible.”\n“Math and I just don’t get along.”\n“Math is OK - I can do most of it but I don’t find it interesting or valuable.”\n“I can do math but am more interested in just applying it.”\n“I find math really interesting, even if I choose not to pursue math for math’s sake.”\n“I love math and will do as much of it as I can.”\n\nWhat ever your category, you should keep in mind:\n\nMath is a skill and takes practice, just like programming.\nYes, it’s true that a lot of high-school is boring. Much of what’s interesting in math comes after calculus.\nThe notion of not being suited to math is just a mindset. It can be changed.\nEven a little math is quite useful.\nYou can learn quite a bit of math via programming, as we’ll show you.\n\nWe’ll have more to say about the interesting and exciting connections between computer science, math, and other fields, including art."

If you just type your program, it will just be sitting there on your computer. But you want to go the next step and run (or, execute, as we say) the program. Typing and not-running is loosely analogous to typing an email but not sending it (the email will just remain in composed-form, but go nowhere) Similarly, typing text into Word doesn’t mean it gets “published”.\nThe “thing” into which you type and run your program is called a code editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, a mouthful).\nWe are going to give you the option of using one of two code editors, Thonny or Spyder. Think of them as apps that help you type and run programs.\n\n\n\nBefore we get to typing in a program, we first (if not already done) need to download and install Python and either Thonny or Spyder.\n\nThe term install means: you download software on your computer and get it to run. This is something you do just once.\nWhen you need to run the software again, you search for it on your computer (since it’s already installed) and merely run it.\nThus, you will perform Steps 1 and 2 just once for this course.\nAnd Steps 3 and 4 repeatedly as you write code.\nAlso, if you start off with one editor and change your mind, you can come back here to install the other editor and learn how to use it.\n\n1.

If you just type your program, it will just be sitting there on your computer. But you want to go the next step and run (or, execute, as we say) the program. Typing and not-running is loosely analogous to typing an email but not sending it (the email will just remain in composed-form, but go nowhere) Similarly, typing text into Word doesn’t mean it gets “published”.\nThe “thing” into which you type and run your program is called a code editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, a mouthful).\nWe are going to give you the option of using one of two code editors, Thonny or Spyder. Think of them as apps that help you type and run programs.\n\n\n\nBefore we get to typing in a program, we first (if not already done) need to download and install Python and either Thonny or Spyder.\n\nThe term install means: you download software on your computer and get it to run.

Also save the file so that it can be submitted (Remember: you need to save the appropriate files for every such “type up” exercise). What does it print? Report what you see in module4.pdf.\n\nNow let’s examine key parts of this program:\nFirst, i is the name of a “box” (of sorts).\nThe term used for “box” is variable.    \n⇒ i is a variable.\nTo put something in a variable, we use assignment  \n⇒ with the repurposed = (equals) sign. \nWhen we print a variable, what gets printed is its value.   \n⇒ Thus, the number 5 gets printed \nImportant: What you see on printed out is the number 5 and NOT the letter i\nThus when you see print(i)you should think:\n\n“Hmmm, the print function is going to print the contents of variable i”.\n“I wonder what’s inside i?”\n“Let me look in the program to see what was the most recent value that got written into i”.\n\n\nFor example:\ni = 5\ni = 3\nprint(i)\n\n\n4.2 Excercise: Type up the above in my_variable_example2.py and confirm that 3 is what gets printed.\nBy way of explanation: \n\n\n4.3 Excercise: Is it possible to not have a value in a variable? Consider this program:\ni\nprint(i)\n Type up the program in my_variable_example3.py. What is the error? Answer in module4.pdf. (Remember, non-coding questions are to be answered in your module pdf, in this case: module4.pdf.)\nThus: when you make a variable, you need to put something in it. - Next, let’s look at assignment between variables: - This is the analogue of cloning between “boxes”.\nConsider this program:\ni = 5\nj = i     # The value in i gets copied into j\nprint(j)  # Prints 5\n\nWe say, in short, “i is assigned to j”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe’ve used comments above to annotate and explain.\n\nWe’ll do this often, knowing that comments are not executed.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Excercise: Consider this program:\ni = 5\nj = i\nprint(j)\nprint(i)   # Did i lose its value?\nType up the program in my_variable_example4.py and report what gets printed in module4.pdf.\nThe above example illustrates that the value in i gets copied into the variable j, which means that the value 5 is still in the variable i.\n\n\n4.5 Excercise: Consider this program:\ni = 5\nj = i\nk = j\nprint(k)\nTry to identify the output of this program just by mental execution. Type up the program in my_variable_example5.py and confirm.\n\n\n4.6 Excercise: Consider this program:\ni = 5\nj = i\ni = 0\nk = j\nj = 0\nprint(k)\n Try to identify the output of this program just by mental execution. Type up the program in my_variable_example6.py and confirm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA copied value does not change if the original is changed\n\n\nFor example, consider:\ni = 5\nj = i      # j now has 5\ni = 0      # We changed i here\nprint(j)   # j still has 5\n\nHere’s the line-by-line execution:\n\nThe first line puts the value 5 in variable i.\nThe second line copies the value in i (which is 5) into j. So j will have the value 5 as well.\nThe third line replaces the value 5 with value 0.\nj still has 5, so the fourth line will print 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n0 is an actual value, and is not “no value” or “nothing”.\n\n\n\n\n4.8 Excercise: Consider this program:\nType up the following lines of code in my_variable_example7.py:\ni = 5\nj = 6      \n\n# Add code between here\n\n# and here.\n\nprint(i)   # should print 6\nprint(j)   # should print 5\nAdd some lines of code with the objective of swapping the values in variables i and j. You will need a third variable to be used as a holding place. Thus, without directly assigning the number 5 to j or the number 6 to i, write code using a third variable to achieve the desired swapping of values."

What does it print? Answer in module4.pdf.\nAbout expressions:\n\nAn expression combines constants (like 1, above), and variables using operators.\nExample: i*j - (i+1)*(j-1).\nThe above expression is really equivalent to: (i*j) - ((i+1) * (j-1)). Here, we added some clarifying parentheses.\nOperator precedence allows us to reduce the number of clarifying parentheses.\nPython precedence follows standard precedence in math: /, *, +, -.\nYou might remember the precedence via the acronyms BODMAS or PEMDAS. (Look it up.)\nThe above expression is NOT the same as: i*j - i+1*j-1.\nAlso, note the change of whitespace:\n\nWe could have written k = i * j - (i + 1) * (j - 1).\nBut k = i*j - (i+1)*(j-1) is easier to read.\n\n\nLet’s dive a bit deeper into precedence and do some examples:\n\nWe’ll use the four operators: add or +, subtraction or -, multiplication or *, and division or /.\nWe’ll use plain ol’ numbers to illustrate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe key to working them out is to use extra parentheses in the right way.\n\n\n\nThe PEMDAS rule:\n\nFirst apply Parentheses, then Exponents, then Multiplication and Division, and then Addition and Subtraction.\n\nExample: 3 + 2*4\n\nHere, we apply 2*4 to give 8\nThen do 3 + 8 to give 11.\nApplying extra parenthesis to 3 + (2*4) makes it clear.\n\nExample: 3(24/3-23)\n\nFirst, work out what’s inside the parens (the P of PEMDAS):\n\nDo div to 24/3 and mult to 2*3 to get (8 - 6)\nThis gives (2)\n\nNow go out and see that we need to do 3*(2)\nWhich gives 6.\nUsing extra parens and spacing makes it clear: 3 * ( (24/3) - (2*3) )\n\nExample: 1 + ( (4 - 1) * 8) / 6\n\nDo the innermost parens first: (4 -1) = 3\nWhich results in 1 + (3 * 8) / 6\nThen the next parens to give: 1 + 24/6\nThen the D in PEMDAS: 1 + 4\nResult: 5\n\n\n\n\n4.12 Excercise: What does the expression i*j - i+1*j-1 evaluate to when i=7 and j=3?

But it turns out to have immense practical value: much of cryptography is based on properties of numbers that can be cleanly divided by only two prime numbers.\n\n\n\nNow we’ll look at a strange (initially) but very useful type of assignment:\nConsider this program:\ni = 8\ni = i + i/2\nprint(i)\n\nPrior to evaluating the expression, i has value 8.\nOn the right side, the current value of i is used to evaluate the expression.       \n⇒ Thus, the expression evaluates to (8 + 8/2) = 12.\nThis evaluated value then goes into variable i.       \n⇒ After the assignment, i has the value 12.\n\nLet’s use this to compute the sum of numbers from 0 to 10:\ns = 0\nfor i in range(0, 11):\n    s = s + i\nprint(s)\n\n\n4.17 Excercise: Trace the changing values of s in the above program using the following kind of table:\n\nWrite up the table in module4.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this and other tracing exercises involving a table, you can simply draw the table by hand and include a picture. (That is, you don’t have to spend time on making tables inside Word.)\n\n\nConsider this program:\nN = 5\ns = 0\nfor i in range(1, N+1):\n    s = s + (2*i - 1)\nprint(s)\n\nThe program prints the sum of the first N odd numbers.\nRecall from earlier that as i goes through 1, 2, 3, … (2*i-1) evaluates as successive odd numbers 1, 3, 5, …\n\n\n\n4.18 Excercise: Trace (in module4.pdf) the values of i and s in the program above. Then, in my_expression_example4.py, edit the code to create an outer loop that varies N from 1 to 10.

Also save the file so that it can be submitted (You will need to save the appropriate files for everysuch “type up” exercise).\nLet’s point out a few things: \n\nLet’s start by distinguishing between a function definition (which uses def and merely tells Python what the function is about), and invocation (which asks Python to execute the function at that moment).\n\nA function definition is a piece of code that begins with the word def\nA function definition is sometimes also called function declaration.\nA function definition does not execute the code immediately.\nInstead it’s like saving in one place a bunch of instructions that can be invoked with just the name of the function.\nThis saves writing lots of code if a group of code can begiven a name (in this case, a function name).\n\nA function definition has 5 elements: \nA function with a given name is defined just once.\nA function invocation merely uses the name, along with parentheses:\n\nprint_big_M()\nWe’ll later see examples where some things can go between the parens.\n\nWhile a particular function is defined once, it can be used any number of times:\n\nIn fact, that is the whole purpose of defining functions.\nEach use of a function is a single line of code, which saves us the trouble of rewriting all the code that was inside the function for each time we need it.\n\nFunction definitions also help isolate code so that one doesn’t have to see or understand what’s inside to use it.\nWe’ve already used such a function before: the print function.\n\nThe printfunction is defined internal to Python.\nWe don’t type its definition, nor do we see it.\nWe just use it as often as we like.\n\nImportant: Please pay careful attention to indentation\n\nThe line that begins with def should NOT be indented.\nOther lines that belong to the function should be indented.\nThere are other forms of indentation that we’ll point out as we proceed - they’re all important.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Exercise: Write your own animal sound that uses one function at least thrice with an exclamation mark at the end, e.g. print the big version of BAAA!. Write your code in my_pet_sound.py. Once your program is working, say the sound out aloud to celebrate. (Why not?)\nNext, let’s see how functions “work” by making a small change to the program:\ndef print_big_M():\n    print('*   *')\n    print('** **')\n    print('* * *')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*   *')\n\ndef print_big_O():\n    print('*****')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*****')\n\nprint('Step 1')\nprint_big_M()\nprint('Step 8')\nprint_big_O()\nprint('Step x')\nprint_big_O()\nprint('Step y')\n\n\n2.4 Exercise: Type up the above in animal_sounds2.py and run it.\nLet’s explain using an analogy: \n\nWe’ll use the analogy of a house to describe a program and its parts (the functions).\nA program’s execution starts at the very top.\nIn the above case, there are a number of definitions:\n\nDefinitions are merely “processed” but not executed.\nIt’s understood that the definitions may be invoked later.\nIn our house analogy, we walk past these “rooms” to the main lobby.\n\nThe first real line of code is the print('Step 1')statement.\n\nThink of this section of code as the “main lobby”.\n\nAfter this, we see the line (also a command) print_big_M()\n\nThis is an instruction that causes the computer to “go to the print_big_M()room”.\nWe then head to that room and start executing commands in there.\n\nThus, the third command that gets executed is print('*   *')\nWe’re still in the room with more commands to go, and the next one (4th so far) is print('** **')\nContinuing, we execute the last line in the room, which will make this the 7th one executed.\nAfter we leave the “room”, and this is important, we continue execution after the invocation that brought us to the room.\n\n\n\n2.5 Exercise: Type up the above in animal_sounds2.py and run it.\nAt which step (which step number) do we execute the last line in print_big_O? And then, at which step do we enter print_big_O the second time and print its first line? In animal_sounds2.py replace x and y with the correct step number. Don’t forget: non-coding responses to exercises go into module2.pdf (one PDF per module)."

You also cannot pick and choose which extension to apply.\nWe’re doing extensions ONLY because because everyone gets ill or has the occasional sudden emergency. It is NOT intended to be used as a tool for time-management or convenience.\nFor all other submissions where the extension does not apply, we will take off 25% per day late. These points taken off will NOT not be pro-rated hourly. Thus, if something is due 5pm March 19th, a submission at 5.05pm March 19th has 25% taken off.\nYou get bonus points if you don’t use any extensions at all and if you don’t submit anything late.\nIf you’re seeking an extension because you’ve been seriously ill and have a letter from a doctor, communicate with the TA.\nYou cannot use any extension resulting in a submission past the last due date."

Likewise, you may not look at anyone else’s code or show your code to anyone else.\nImportant: We have sophisticated tools that automatically examine all students’ code and that perform a comparison. These tools are very good at determining similarity in code. We also reserve the right to ask you probing questions about submitted work; failure to answer these questions may result in loss of points for the submitted work.\nImportant: Parts of the final exam will feature small variations of the assigned work but without electronic access to your computer. Thus, you will succeed in the exam only if you actually do the assigned work.\nIf you use material in your assignments that are from outside the course material, then you should be prepared to explain that material. The instructors and TAs reserve the right to question you on your use of any extraneous material. Failure to answer such questions might be viewed as grounds for an integrity violation.\nThe Academic Integrity Code will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully. Penalties for violating the code or the policies described here include failing this course.\nIf you have a disability that may effect your participation in this course and wish to discuss academic acommodations, please contact us as soon as possible."
