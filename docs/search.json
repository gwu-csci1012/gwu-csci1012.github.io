For example: you will make a file called module0.pdf in your module0 folder.\nWhen is the PDF file to be used? The single PDF (one per module) is used when you are to write responses outside of Python code.

    "text": "Objectives\nBy the end of this module you will be able to: - Experince writing a really simple program. - Explain the difference between command-line outputs vs GUI for programs.\n\n0.0: Our First Program\nLets take a look at our first program as it appears in a textbook (like this one):\nprint(\"Hello World\")\nThis is a simple program written in the Python programming language, possibly one of the smallest programs one can write, and a traditional starting point for learning programming.\nWe will very soon (below) write this program ourselves.\nFor now, let’s point out a few things:\n\nWhat we see above is the text of the program. \nThe entire program will appear inside of a code editor when we write.\nWe could use one of several code editors.\nFor example, this is how it would look inside the Spyder code editor: \nAnd how it might look in the Thonny code editor: \nVarious editors colorize in different ways for convenience of reading, none of which affect the actual text of the program.\nApart from typing it in (which you’ll do shortly), we haven’t actually run the program.\nIntuitively, just looking at the program we might think that:\n\nIt has to do with some kind of “printing” (because we see print)\nWe have no idea what is meant by the somewhat odd phrase “Hello World!”, but we see it there.\n\nThere are several ways to run a program:\n\nRun the program inside the very same editor used to type in the program.\nRun it without any editor (a slightly advanced topic).\n\nFor example, if we run the program using the Thonny editor, we will see this: \n\nNext, you will try this yourself.\n\n0.1 Excercise: Write and run the helloworld program using these instructions\nSo, what’s with printing the unusual phrase “Hello World!”?\n\nIt’s a tradition in computer science that your first program will print “Hello World!”.\nIt’s meant to pretend that a program is a creature that’s itself communicating to the outside world by saying hello.\n\n\n\n\n0.1 The recipe-cook-dish analogy\nWhat just happened above?\nLet’s use an analogy \n\nA recipe is a bunch of instructions in text form.       ⇒ A program is also a set of instructions in text form.\nBy itself, a recipe doesn’t do anything until it’s acted on.       ⇒ You can type up a program but not do anything with it (i.e., not run it).\nA cook executes a recipe by following the instructions       ⇒ A combination of elements in your laptop executes a program.\nThe net result of a cook executing a recipe is, typically, a dish.       ⇒ The result of executing a program is the program’s output\nWe of course design and write up programs to get useful or interesting output.\nWhen a recipe is poorly written, or if the cook messes up, the result may be failure.       ⇒ A program and the laptop are even more exacting: the slightest error can result in failure.\n\n\n\n0.2 Programming vs. computerese\nWhat we mean by computerese:\n\nThe computer-related tasks and knowledge that are needed, but not the intellectual core of programming.\nWe use the term slightly pejoratively, like legalese.       ⇒ A necessary evil.\nExamples of computerese:\n\nNavigating directories\nLocating files, copying them, moving them.\nMastery of editor keys, shortcuts.\nHandling the quirks of an operating system.\nUploading files to a website, downloading.\n\n\n\n0.2 Excercise: Develop your computerese skills by following these instructions.\n(Note: there is nothing to submit for this particula exercise; it is aimed at generally helping you get proficien with using your computer for programming.)\n\n\n\n0.3 A slight variation\nWe will now spend a bit of time trying a few variations, and also examining what happens when typing mistakes are made.\nConsider this program: \nprint('Hello World!')\nprint('My name is X')\n\n0.3 Excercise: Type up this program but use your own name instead of X. Save the file in the module0 folder as myname.py. Note: in the future we will be asking you to “type up” programs; in all such cases, please also save the file (for eventual submission).\n\n\n\n0.4 What happens when things go (even slightly) wrong\nWe’ll now deliberately make a few tiny errors and see what happens:\n\nError #1: forgetting to type the closing parenthesis.\n\nHere’s the program:\n\nprint('Hello World!'\nNote the missing right parenthesis at the end of the line.\n\nWhat happens when we nonetheless try and run the program?\n\nHere’s an example with the Thonny editor: \n\nError #2: What happens if we forget the quotation marks?\n\nHere’s the program:\n\nprint(Hello World!)\n\nWe get something quite similar: \n\n\n\n0.4 Excercise: Confirm that you get the errors above by typing up the two programs as error1.py and save the programs in the module0 folder.\n\n\n\n0.5 A peek at a more complex program\nJust to see what’s coming later, let’s get a sense of what a more complex program looks like.\nYour goal is to look through it with bemused curiosity, as if studying an incomprensible work of abstract art.\nWe’ll just examine the some surface features, as we would when examining some undeciphered ancient script such as: \nLet’s start by running the program.\n\n0.5 Excercise: Download whackamole.py into your module0.py folder Then open it and run it. You should see\n The purpose of the program and how you use it should be easy to figure out.\nLet’s point out a few things:\n\nUnlike the toy helloworld.py example, this program actually does something nontrivial.\nThe program brings up a window, and allows a user to interact with it (the program).\n\nNow let’s list the program and then point out some “surface” features.\nThe full program:\n# whackamole with nerf gun\n\n# Use programs written by others through \"import\"\nimport tkinter as tk  \n\n# Define a window\nwindow = tk.Tk()\n\n# The instructions at the top\ninstructions = 'Click reset, then click fire to strike the mole'\nlabel = tk.Label(text=instructions)\nlabel.pack()\n\n# Build a rectangular space on which to draw \n# shapes like circles\nw = 300\nh = 200\ncanvas = tk.Canvas(master=window, width=w, height=h)\ncanvas.pack()\n\n# These are variables that control the \n# position of the target and nerf ball\ntargetX = 0\ntargetVX = 10\nnerfX = 0\nnerfY = h-10\nnerfVX = 20\nnerfVY = 0\nnerfAY = -3\ndelT = 0.1\nnerfFired = False\n\n\n# This is what we want to do when the \n# reset button is clicked:\ndef reset():\n    global nerfFired, targetX, nerfX, nerfY, nerfVY\n    nerfFired = False\n    targetX = 0\n    nerfX = 0\n    nerfY = h-1\n    nerfVY = 0\n    canvas.delete(\"all\")\n    print('reset')\n\n# When the fire button is clicked, we change \n# the status of the nerf gun\ndef fire():\n    # start launch\n    global nerfFired\n    nerfFired = True\n    print('fired')\n\n# Build the three buttons called \"reset\", \"fire\" and \"quit\"\nframe = tk.Frame(master=window)\nframe.pack()\n\nresetb = tk.Button(\n    master=frame, text=\"reset\", relief=tk.RIDGE, \n    fg='black', bg='grey', height=2, width=5,command=reset)\nresetb.grid(row=0, column=0)\n\nfireb = tk.Button(\n    master=frame, text=\"fire\", relief=tk.RIDGE, \n    fg='black', bg='grey', height=2, width=5, command=fire)\nfireb.grid(row=0, column=1)\n\nquitb = tk.Button(\n    master=frame, text=\"quit\", relief=tk.RIDGE, fg='black', \n    bg='grey', height=2, width=5, command=window.destroy)\nquitb.grid(row=0, column=2)\n\n# This part of the code draws and animates\ndef run():\n    global targetX, nerfX, nerfVY, nerfY\n    canvas.delete(\"all\")\n    targetX += targetVX * delT\n    canvas.create_rectangle(\n        targetX, h-10, targetX+10, h, fill=\"green\")\n    if nerfFired:\n        nerfX += nerfVX * delT\n        nerfVY += nerfAY * delT\n        nerfY += nerfVY * delT\n    canvas.create_oval(\n        nerfX+5,h-nerfY+5, nerfX+15, h-nerfY+15, \n        fill=\"red\")\n    window.after(1, run)\n\n# Launch the window and start the animation\nwindow.after(1, run)\nwindow.mainloop()\nYes, that’s a long program! Now let’s point out some features:\nFirst, some features from the first half of the program: \nAnd some from the latter part:And some from the latter part: \n\n\n\n0.6 GUI vs command-line\nGUI stands for: Graphical User Interface.\nAnd is pronounced like “gooey”.\nThe difference between GUI and command-line programs:\n\nPrograms like helloworld.py from earlier printed plain text. These are Command-line programs.\nPrograms like whackamole.py bring up their own little window on your screen. These are called GUI programs.\nGUI programs are typically more complicated because one has to specify all the elements (buttons etc) of the interface.\nWe will spend quite a bit of time learning programming with simpler (albeit less exciting) command-line programs.\nHowever, we will occasionally work with GUI programs because they are visually more interesting, and demonstrate applications.\n\n\n\n0.8 Computer science: beyond programming\nIs computer science the same as programming?\nNot at all:\nProgramming is certainly a significant part, just as narrative non-fiction is a significant part of an English degree.        ⇒ But there’s much more to it.\nWhat else does a computer science degree feature? Typically:\n\nProgramming devices (units 9-10).\nAn understanding of the hardware (units 11-12).\nAlgorithms: the science in computer science.\nTheory: understanding fundamental theoretical limitations of computation.\nA deeper understanding of how computer systems work: networks, databases, operating systems.\n\nBut also electives among (to name a few):\n\nArtificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, natural language processing.\nDesign of interfaces.\nGraphics, animation, visualization.\nDigital humanities, computing for arts and social sciences.\nScientific computing.\nComputational X, where X=biology, physics, economics …\nEducational tools, health data systems.\nMedical devices, prosthetics, control of mechanical systems\n\n\n\n0.8 How to succeed as a student\nThe challenge in learning programming:\n1: it’s an alien world.        ⇒ Takes getting used to.\n2: it’s a mental skill        ⇒ Skills are acquired slowly, with much practice, and in fits and starts.\n3: there are confounding issues        ⇒ some knowledge of (regrettably) computerese needed.\n4: it’s easy to feel overwhelmed or intimidated        ⇒ your neighbor may appear to be “getting it” while you feel you don’t.\nWhat you should expect:\n\nYou can’t learn instantly        ⇒ You may have to see a concept multiple times to “get it”.\nYou may occasionally feel bewildered.\nThere are some things that can’t be understoodat this stage.        ⇒ Not enough background.\nIt’s deceptively easy to understand an idea when reading or viewing but devilishly harder to do it yourself.\n\nHow to succeed:\n\nMake progress every day        ⇒ Each module builds on previous modules        ⇒ Can’t afford to let anything slide.\nBe willing to put the effort        ⇒ Do all exercises, assignments etc.\nPractice being irrepressibly positive.\n\n\n0.6 Excercise: Create a PDF file (using Word, Google-docs, or anything like that) called module0.pdf in your module0.pdf folder. This document should contain: (1) a picture that says something about you (it need not be a picture of you, it could represent something iconic for you.) (2) a paragraph about yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhat to rememeber about submitting work"

    "text": "Academic Integrity policy\n\nIn this course, you will be expected to work on all assigned coursework by yourself, unless otherwise specified by instructions on this site.\nYou may not, without permission from the instructor, exchange course-related code with anyone (including anyone not registered in the course), or download code for use in your coursework, or use material from books other than the textbook. Likewise, you may not look at anyone else’s code or show your code to anyone else.\nImportant: We have sophisticated tools that automatically examine all students’ code and that perform a comparison. These tools are very good at determining similarity in code. We also reserve the right to ask you probing questions about submitted work; failure to answer these questions may result in loss of points for the submitted work.\nImportant: Parts of the final exam will feature small variations of the assigned work but without electronic access to your computer. Thus, you will succeed in the exam only if you actually do the assigned work.\nIf you use material in your assignments that are from outside the course material, then you should be prepared to explain that material. The instructors and TAs reserve the right to question you on your use of any extraneous material. Failure to answer such questions might be viewed as grounds for an integrity violation.\nThe Academic Integrity Code will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully. Penalties for violating the code or the policies described here include failing this course.\nIf you have a disability that may effect your participation in this course and wish to discuss academic acommodations, please contact us as soon as possible."
