We don’t have to increment the for-loop variable by 1.\nfor i in range(10, 16, 2):\n    print(i)\n\nThis prints the numbers 10, 12, 14.\nThe number 2 in range(10, 16, 2) specifies an increment amount.\nThus, we start with i taking the value 10 in the first iteration.\nIn the second iteration, i becomes 12 (because 10+2 = 12).\nIn the third iteration, i becomes 14 (incrementing 12 by 2).\nIf we were to increment 14 by 2 it becomes 16 which is past the last value allowed.\nImportant: think of 16 as “the variable cannot have this value or anything past this value”.\n\n4. We can decrement, as in:\nfor i in range(16, 10, -1):\n    print(i)\n\nThis will print 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11.\nWe start with 16 (the first part of the range).\nAfter each iteration we apply the increment/decrement amount.\nIn this case, applying -1 to 16 gives us 15, which gets printed.\nThen, the third time through, i becomes 14. And so on.\nIn the last iteration, i becomes 11.\nFinally, when i is decremented to 10, the loop is ended.\n\n\n3.6 Excercise: Type up the above four examples in my_forloop_variation1.py, my_forloop_variation2.py, my_forloop_variation3.py, and my_forloop_variation4.py.

    "text": "3.3 Tracing through a program in detail\nWe’ll now look at an example of how to execute a program “by hand”. That is, how to trace a program’s execution by painstakingly following its execution step-by-step.\nAt first this will appear tedious, but it is critical to a firm understanding of how programs execute, and eventually to your own writing of programs.\nWe’ll first do a longer, more narrative version here, and then show you how to submit a much shorter version for your exercises.\nFor our example, let’s look at the program we last saw:\nprint(1)                   \n\nfor j in range(2, 5):      \n    for i in range(j):     \n        print(j, end='')\n    print()    \nLet’s now dive into the longer version, just for the sake of understanding.\nTo make best use of this:\n\nOpen this same page in another browser, and have the program side-by-side, as you read what’s below.\nRead out aloud what you see below.\n\nReady? Let’s trace through: \n\nRight at the start, the first line is print(1). This prints out 1, and moves to the next line. \nInitially j=2 at the start of the outer for-loop: \nSince j is 2, it’s within the range, and we enter the outer for-loop.\n\nNow we encounter the inner for-loop, where i is set to 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nwhen range has only one number specified, it’s understood to be the upper limit.\n\n\nThe upper limit is the current value of j, which is 2. \nInside the inner loop, we execute print(1), which, because j is now 2, will print 2. \nWe’re at the end of the inner loop, so now i increments to 1: \nSo now inside the inner-loop, we print 2 again \nThen, at the end of the inner for-loop, we return to the top where i increments to 2.\nSince i is at the limit, we exit the inner for-loop. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe inner loop iterated twice.\n\n\n\nNext, we go past the inner loop to print(), which goes to the beginning of the next line. \nThis completes the first iteration of the outer, after which we go to the top of the outerloop and increment j. \nExecution now enters the outerloop with j set to 3.\n\nNow we encounter the inner for-loop, where i is set to 0\nThe upper limit is the current value of j, which is 3.\nSo, the inner loop executes three times, with i first set to 0, then to 1, then to 2.\nThis will result in printing three 3’s.\nWhen i becomes 3, it hits the inner-loop limit and proceeds to the print() that follows.\nThe output so far is:\n\n1\n2 2\n3 3 3\nThis completes the iterations of the inner loop with the outer loop j set to 3.\nNext, j becomes 4 \n\nThe inner loop starts with i set to 0.\nEach time through i increments.\nUntil i hits the limit j (which is 4 now).\nThis results in four 4’s being printed in a line.\nThen we come out of the inner loop and execute print(), which goes to the next line.\n\nThe output so far is\n\n1\n2 2\n3 3 3\n4 4 4 4\n\nFinally at the end of the outer loop, j becomes 5 and hits the limit of the outer loop \n\nYes, that was long. But doing this many times will help you understand how to read programs. Later, you will become good at this and will, with a quick glance at the inner-loop, say “Oh, this prints 2 twice in the first iteration of the outer.”\nImportant: when you need to submit a program’s traced-out execution, use a shorter version. For example, see this PDF for the above program.\n\n3.14 Excercise: Consider this program:\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    for j in range(i, 0, -1):\n        print('*', end='')\n    print(' ', end='')\n    for j in range(1, i):\n        print('-', end='')\n    print()\n\n\nFirst, trace through the values of i and j by hand and try to figure out what gets printed. Do this painstakingly for each possible value of i and j, remembering that i is now the name of the outerloop variable. Write your tracing in module3.pdf, using the shorter “table” format we saw in see this PDF for the above program earlier. Then, edit, compile and execute the above program in my_forloop_trace.py.to see if you were right.\n\n\n3.15 Video: \n\n\n\n3.16 Excercise: Consider this program:\nWrite a program to print out consecutive integers in a diagonal, as in\n1\n 2\n  3\n   4\n    5\nUse a nested for-loop as in earlier examples to print the requisite number of spaces before printing a digit. Write your code in my_diagonal_print.py.\n\n\n3.17 Excercise: Consider this program:\nWrite a program to print out\nI'm feeling cold: b rrrrrr rrrrr rrrr rrr rr r\nUse a regular print to print everything up to the b.

For now, we’re just pointing them out.\nAnother example of a reserved word we’ve seen: def\nIt turns out that, even though print looks like it should be a reserved word, it’s in fact not.\n\nAt this stage, the distinction is not clear and that’s fine.\nAs you learn the language, you’ll learn how to distinguish.\n\n\nCounting from 0:\n\nWhen a single number like 6 is specified in the range as in range(6) \nThus, i is 0 the first time, then 1, then 2, and so on until i = 5 (last time through).\nThe number 6 specifies that i cannot be 6 or higher.\nThus, there is a certain strangeness to get used to:\n\nUnlike math (where counting starts from 1), in programming, the convention is to start from 0.  (Did you notice that’s why we started with Module 0?)\nThe other strangeness is specifying the limit as one higher (6) than than last iteration value (5).\n\n\nThe different uses of range\n\nWhen a single number is specified, as in range(6) the implied start is 0.\nWhen two numbers are specified as in: range(10, 16) the first is the start of the count, and the second is the limit: \n\nThus i is 10 the first time (this is the first thing that’s printed).\nThen i becomes 11.\nThen 12, and so on until the last time through when i is 15.\n\nWhen three numbers are specified as in range(10, 16, 2) the third number is the increment. \n\nHere, i starts as 10 in the first iteration.\nThen, i is 12 in the second iteration.\nThen i becomes 14. This is the last iteration because after that i would be 16, which ends the loop.\n\nUsing range(10, 15, 2) produces the same result as above, and in fact preferable.\n\nAbout comments:\n\nFirst, comments are for us to read. The computer does not read them.\nThus, in terms of execution, this program\n\n# list the even numbers between 10 and 14, inclusive:\nfor i in range(10, 15, 2):    # Notice the increment\n    print(i)\nwill result in the exact output as this one:\nfor i in range(10, 15, 2):\n    print(i)\n\nWe will use comments in two ways, as in the above example:\n\nThe first comment is an example of using a comment as a prelude to code, to explain what’s coming or intended.\nThe second kind that is to the right side of a line of code is like an alert: we’ll use this to point out something to pay attention to in that line of code."

    "text": "Objectives\nBy the end of this module you will be able to:\n\nExperince writing a really simple program.\nExplain the difference between command-line outputs vs GUI for programs.\n\n\n0.0: Our First Program\nLets take a look at our first program as it appears in a textbook (like this one):\nprint(\"Hello World\")\nThis is a simple program written in the Python programming language, possibly one of the smallest programs one can write, and a traditional starting point for learning programming.\nWe will very soon (below) write this program ourselves.\nFor now, let’s point out a few things:\n\nWhat we see above is the text of the program. \nThe entire program will appear inside of a code editor when we write.\nWe could use one of several code editors.\nFor example, this is how it would look inside the Spyder code editor: \nAnd how it might look in the Thonny code editor: \nVarious editors colorize in different ways for convenience of reading, none of which affect the actual text of the program.\nApart from typing it in (which you’ll do shortly), we haven’t actually run the program.\nIntuitively, just looking at the program we might think that:\n\nIt has to do with some kind of “printing” (because we see print)\nWe have no idea what is meant by the somewhat odd phrase “Hello World!”, but we see it there.\n\nThere are several ways to run a program:\n\nRun the program inside the very same editor used to type in the program.\nRun it without any editor (a slightly advanced topic).\n\nFor example, if we run the program using the Thonny editor, we will see this: \n\nNext, you will try this yourself.\n\n0.1 Excercise: Write and run the helloworld program using these instructions\nSo, what’s with printing the unusual phrase “Hello World!”?\n\nIt’s a tradition in computer science that your first program will print “Hello World!”.\nIt’s meant to pretend that a program is a creature that’s itself communicating to the outside world by saying hello.\n\n\n\n\n0.1 The recipe-cook-dish analogy\nWhat just happened above?\nLet’s use an analogy \n\nA recipe is a bunch of instructions in text form.       ⇒ A program is also a set of instructions in text form.\nBy itself, a recipe doesn’t do anything until it’s acted on.       ⇒ You can type up a program but not do anything with it (i.e., not run it).\nA cook executes a recipe by following the instructions       ⇒ A combination of elements in your laptop executes a program.\nThe net result of a cook executing a recipe is, typically, a dish.       ⇒ The result of executing a program is the program’s output\nWe of course design and write up programs to get useful or interesting output.\nWhen a recipe is poorly written, or if the cook messes up, the result may be failure.       ⇒ A program and the laptop are even more exacting: the slightest error can result in failure.\n\n\n\n0.2 Programming vs. computerese\nWhat we mean by computerese:\n\nThe computer-related tasks and knowledge that are needed, but not the intellectual core of programming.\nWe use the term slightly pejoratively, like legalese.       ⇒ A necessary evil.\nExamples of computerese:\n\nNavigating directories\nLocating files, copying them, moving them.\nMastery of editor keys, shortcuts.\nHandling the quirks of an operating system.\nUploading files to a website, downloading.\n\n\n\n0.2 Excercise: Develop your computerese skills by following these instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere is nothing to submit for this particula exercise; it is aimed at generally helping you get proficien with using your computer for programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n0.3 A slight variation\nWe will now spend a bit of time trying a few variations, and also examining what happens when typing mistakes are made.\nConsider this program: \nprint('Hello World!')\nprint('My name is X')\n\n0.3 Excercise: Type up this program but use your own name instead of X. Save the file in the module0 folder as myname.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the future we will be asking you to “type up” programs; in all such cases, please also save the file (for eventual submission)\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4 What happens when things go (even slightly) wrong\nWe’ll now deliberately make a few tiny errors and see what happens:\n\nError #1: forgetting to type the closing parenthesis.\n\nHere’s the program:\n\nprint('Hello World!'\nNote the missing right parenthesis at the end of the line.\n\nWhat happens when we nonetheless try and run the program?\n\nHere’s an example with the Thonny editor: \n\nError #2: What happens if we forget the quotation marks?\n\nHere’s the program:\n\nprint(Hello World!)\n\nWe get something quite similar: \n\n\n\n0.4 Excercise: Confirm that you get the errors above by typing up the two programs as error1.py and save the programs in the module0 folder.\n\n\n\n0.5 A peek at a more complex program\nJust to see what’s coming later, let’s get a sense of what a more complex program looks like.\nYour goal is to look through it with bemused curiosity, as if studying an incomprensible work of abstract art.\nWe’ll just examine the some surface features, as we would when examining some undeciphered ancient script such as: \nLet’s start by running the program.\n\n0.5 Excercise: Download whackamole.py into your module0.py folder Then open it and run it. You should see\n The purpose of the program and how you use it should be easy to figure out.\nLet’s point out a few things:\n\nUnlike the toy helloworld.py example, this program actually does something nontrivial.\nThe program brings up a window, and allows a user to interact with it (the program).\n\nNow let’s list the program and then point out some “surface” features.\nThe full program:\n# whackamole with nerf gun\n\n# Use programs written by others through \"import\"\nimport tkinter as tk  \n\n# Define a window\nwindow = tk.Tk()\n\n# The instructions at the top\ninstructions = 'Click reset, then click fire to strike the mole'\nlabel = tk.Label(text=instructions)\nlabel.pack()\n\n# Build a rectangular space on which to draw \n# shapes like circles\nw = 300\nh = 200\ncanvas = tk.Canvas(master=window, width=w, height=h)\ncanvas.pack()\n\n# These are variables that control the \n# position of the target and nerf ball\ntargetX = 0\ntargetVX = 10\nnerfX = 0\nnerfY = h-10\nnerfVX = 20\nnerfVY = 0\nnerfAY = -3\ndelT = 0.1\nnerfFired = False\n\n\n# This is what we want to do when the \n# reset button is clicked:\ndef reset():\n    global nerfFired, targetX, nerfX, nerfY, nerfVY\n    nerfFired = False\n    targetX = 0\n    nerfX = 0\n    nerfY = h-1\n    nerfVY = 0\n    canvas.delete(\"all\")\n    print('reset')\n\n# When the fire button is clicked, we change \n# the status of the nerf gun\ndef fire():\n    # start launch\n    global nerfFired\n    nerfFired = True\n    print('fired')\n\n# Build the three buttons called \"reset\", \"fire\" and \"quit\"\nframe = tk.Frame(master=window)\nframe.pack()\n\nresetb = tk.Button(\n    master=frame, text=\"reset\", relief=tk.RIDGE, \n    fg='black', bg='grey', height=2, width=5,command=reset)\nresetb.grid(row=0, column=0)\n\nfireb = tk.Button(\n    master=frame, text=\"fire\", relief=tk.RIDGE, \n    fg='black', bg='grey', height=2, width=5, command=fire)\nfireb.grid(row=0, column=1)\n\nquitb = tk.Button(\n    master=frame, text=\"quit\", relief=tk.RIDGE, fg='black', \n    bg='grey', height=2, width=5, command=window.destroy)\nquitb.grid(row=0, column=2)\n\n# This part of the code draws and animates\ndef run():\n    global targetX, nerfX, nerfVY, nerfY\n    canvas.delete(\"all\")\n    targetX += targetVX * delT\n    canvas.create_rectangle(\n        targetX, h-10, targetX+10, h, fill=\"green\")\n    if nerfFired:\n        nerfX += nerfVX * delT\n        nerfVY += nerfAY * delT\n        nerfY += nerfVY * delT\n    canvas.create_oval(\n        nerfX+5,h-nerfY+5, nerfX+15, h-nerfY+15, \n        fill=\"red\")\n    window.after(1, run)\n\n# Launch the window and start the animation\nwindow.after(1, run)\nwindow.mainloop()\nYes, that’s a long program! Now let’s point out some features:\nFirst, some features from the first half of the program: \nAnd some from the latter part:And some from the latter part: \n\n\n\n0.6 GUI vs command-line\nGUI stands for: Graphical User Interface.\nAnd is pronounced like “gooey”.\nThe difference between GUI and command-line programs:\n\nPrograms like helloworld.py from earlier printed plain text. These are Command-line programs.\nPrograms like whackamole.py bring up their own little window on your screen. These are called GUI programs.\nGUI programs are typically more complicated because one has to specify all the elements (buttons etc) of the interface.\nWe will spend quite a bit of time learning programming with simpler (albeit less exciting) command-line programs.\nHowever, we will occasionally work with GUI programs because they are visually more interesting, and demonstrate applications.\n\n\n\n0.8 Computer science: beyond programming\nIs computer science the same as programming?\nNot at all:\nProgramming is certainly a significant part, just as narrative non-fiction is a significant part of an English degree.        ⇒ But there’s much more to it.\nWhat else does a computer science degree feature? Typically:\n\nProgramming devices (units 9-10).\nAn understanding of the hardware (units 11-12).\nAlgorithms: the science in computer science.\nTheory: understanding fundamental theoretical limitations of computation.\nA deeper understanding of how computer systems work: networks, databases, operating systems.\n\nBut also electives among (to name a few):\n\nArtificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, natural language processing.\nDesign of interfaces.\nGraphics, animation, visualization.\nDigital humanities, computing for arts and social sciences.\nScientific computing.\nComputational X, where X=biology, physics, economics …\nEducational tools, health data systems.\nMedical devices, prosthetics, control of mechanical systems\n\n\n\n0.8 How to succeed as a student\nThe challenge in learning programming:\n1: it’s an alien world.        ⇒ Takes getting used to.\n2: it’s a mental skill        ⇒ Skills are acquired slowly, with much practice, and in fits and starts.\n3: there are confounding issues        ⇒ some knowledge of (regrettably) computerese needed.\n4: it’s easy to feel overwhelmed or intimidated        ⇒ your neighbor may appear to be “getting it” while you feel you don’t.\nWhat you should expect:\n\nYou can’t learn instantly        ⇒ You may have to see a concept multiple times to “get it”.\nYou may occasionally feel bewildered.\nThere are some things that can’t be understoodat this stage.        ⇒ Not enough background.\nIt’s deceptively easy to understand an idea when reading or viewing but devilishly harder to do it yourself.\n\nHow to succeed:\n\nMake progress every day        ⇒ Each module builds on previous modules        ⇒ Can’t afford to let anything slide.\nBe willing to put the effort        ⇒ Do all exercises, assignments etc.\nPractice being irrepressibly positive.\n\n\n0.6 Excercise: Create a PDF file (using Word, Google-docs, or anything like that) called module0.pdf in your module0.pdf folder. This document should contain: (1) a picture that says something about you (it need not be a picture of you, it could represent something iconic for you.) (2) a paragraph about yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhat to rememeber about submitting work\n\n\n Next Module: Module 1"

Write your answer in module1.pdf\nStrings can embed special so-called escape sequences that begin with backslash.\nThis will give us one way to print a quote:\nprint('My friend\\'s friend\\'s dog\\'s friend')\nAnother way is to use one set of quotes to delimit the string that are different from the ones used within:\nprint('My friend\\'s friend\\'s dog\\'s friend')\nprint(\"bit my friend's dog's ankle\")\nprint('who yelped \"owww\"')\nHow does one print a backslash itself? By using a double backslash:\nprint('The backslash character, \\\\, is less intimidating now')\n\n\n1.9 Excercise: Write a program called practice_escaping.py that prints out\n  \"    \"   \\\\\\\n  \"    \"    \\    \n  \"\"\"\"\"\"    \\    \n  \"    \"    \\    \n  \"    \"   \\\\\\  \n\n\n1.10 Video:\n\nAnother use of backslash: to make long strings\n\nSometimes we need to type in a really long string.\nThe following does NOT work:\n\nprint('An Ogden Nash poem:')\nprint('The camel has a single hump; \nThe dromedary, two; \nOr else the other way around. \nI’m never sure. Are you?')\n\n\n1.11 Excercise: Write a program called my_string_example4.py with the above program and run it. What is the error you observe? Write your answer in module1.pdf\nTo spread a single string over multiple lines, one uses a triple quote as in:\nprint('An Ogden Nash poem:')\nprint('''The camel has a single hump; \nThe dromedary, two; \nOr else the other way around. \nI’m never sure. Are you?''')\n\n\n1.12 Excercise: Write a program called my_string_example5.py with a 5-line limerick.\nEmpty strings: - It is possible to not have anything in a string, as in:\nprint('')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are no letters, digits or anything between the two single quotes above.\n\n\n\nSuch a string is called an empty string.\nOdd as it may seem, empty strings are useful (we’ll see later) when you want to add strings to make a longer string."

Also save the file so that it can be submitted (You will need to save the appropriate files for everysuch “type up” exercise).\nLet’s point out a few things: \n\nLet’s start by distinguishing between a function definition (which uses def and merely tells Python what the function is about), and invocation (which asks Python to execute the function at that moment).\n\nA function definition is a piece of code that begins with the word def\nA function definition is sometimes also called function declaration.\nA function definition does not execute the code immediately.\nInstead it’s like saving in one place a bunch of instructions that can be invoked with just the name of the function.\nThis saves writing lots of code if a group of code can begiven a name (in this case, a function name).\n\nA function definition has 5 elements: \nA function with a given name is defined just once.\nA function invocation merely uses the name, along with parentheses:\n\nprint_big_M()\nWe’ll later see examples where some things can go between the parens.\n\nWhile a particular function is defined once, it can be used any number of times:\n\nIn fact, that is the whole purpose of defining functions.\nEach use of a function is a single line of code, which saves us the trouble of rewriting all the code that was inside the function for each time we need it.\n\nFunction definitions also help isolate code so that one doesn’t have to see or understand what’s inside to use it.\nWe’ve already used such a function before: the print function.\n\nThe printfunction is defined internal to Python.\nWe don’t type its definition, nor do we see it.\nWe just use it as often as we like.\n\nImportant: Please pay careful attention to indentation\n\nThe line that begins with def should NOT be indented.\nOther lines that belong to the function should be indented.\nThere are other forms of indentation that we’ll point out as we proceed - they’re all important.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Video:\n\n\n\n2.3 Exercise: Write your own animal sound that uses one function at least thrice with an exclamation mark at the end, e.g. print the big version of BAAA!. Write your code in my_pet_sound.py. Once your program is working, say the sound out aloud to celebrate. (Why not?)\nNext, let’s see how functions “work” by making a small change to the program:\ndef print_big_M():\n    print('*   *')\n    print('** **')\n    print('* * *')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*   *')\n\ndef print_big_O():\n    print('*****')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*****')\n\nprint('Step 1')\nprint_big_M()\nprint('Step 8')\nprint_big_O()\nprint('Step x')\nprint_big_O()\nprint('Step y')\n\n\n2.4 Exercise: Type up the above in animal_sounds2.py and run it.\nLet’s explain using an analogy: \n\nWe’ll use the analogy of a house to describe a program and its parts (the functions).\nA program’s execution starts at the very top.\nIn the above case, there are a number of definitions:\n\nDefinitions are merely “processed” but not executed.\nIt’s understood that the definitions may be invoked later.\nIn our house analogy, we walk past these “rooms” to the main lobby.\n\nThe first real line of code is the print('Step 1')statement.\n\nThink of this section of code as the “main lobby”.\n\nAfter this, we see the line (also a command) print_big_M()\n\nThis is an instruction that causes the computer to “go to the print_big_M()room”.\nWe then head to that room and start executing commands in there.\n\nThus, the third command that gets executed is print('*   *')\nWe’re still in the room with more commands to go, and the next one (4th so far) is print('** **')\nContinuing, we execute the last line in the room, which will make this the 7th one executed.\nAfter we leave the “room”, and this is important, we continue execution after the invocation that brought us to the room.\n\n\n\n2.5 Exercise: Type up the above in animal_sounds2.py and run it.\nAt which step (which step number) do we execute the last line in print_big_O? And then, at which step do we enter print_big_O the second time and print its first line? In animal_sounds2.py replace x and y with the correct step number.

(That is, you can’t submit something three days late, and claim that you’ve used only part of the 4-day extension.) You do NOT need to tell us you are using an extension, we will merely apply the best fit in the order we get the submissions. You also cannot pick and choose which extension to apply.\nWe’re doing extensions ONLY because because everyone gets ill or has the occasional sudden emergency. It is NOT intended to be used as a tool for time-management or convenience.\nFor all other submissions where the extension does not apply, we will take off 25% per day late. These points taken off will NOT not be pro-rated hourly. Thus, if something is due 5pm March 19th, a submission at 5.05pm March 19th has 25% taken off.\nYou get bonus points if you don’t use any extensions at all and if you don’t submit anything late.\nIf you’re seeking an extension because you’ve been seriously ill and have a letter from a doctor, communicate with the TA.\nYou cannot use any extension resulting in a submission past the last due date."

Likewise, you may not look at anyone else’s code or show your code to anyone else.\nImportant: We have sophisticated tools that automatically examine all students’ code and that perform a comparison. These tools are very good at determining similarity in code. We also reserve the right to ask you probing questions about submitted work; failure to answer these questions may result in loss of points for the submitted work.\nImportant: Parts of the final exam will feature small variations of the assigned work but without electronic access to your computer. Thus, you will succeed in the exam only if you actually do the assigned work.\nIf you use material in your assignments that are from outside the course material, then you should be prepared to explain that material. The instructors and TAs reserve the right to question you on your use of any extraneous material. Failure to answer such questions might be viewed as grounds for an integrity violation.\nThe Academic Integrity Code will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully. Penalties for violating the code or the policies described here include failing this course.\nIf you have a disability that may effect your participation in this course and wish to discuss academic acommodations, please contact us as soon as possible."
