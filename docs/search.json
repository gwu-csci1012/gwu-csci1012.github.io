    "text": "Why are there no recorded video lectures?\nLearning to program by watching some talk about it is less effective than learning by “doing programming”. Thus, most of your learning will consist of reading a concept, seeing an example, and immediately following that with a programming exercise that really gets into the details. At the same time, we know it’s useful to have hints and explanations to help you in your exercises, when you are particularly stuck. Accordingly, although most of the material is written, and includes elaborate instructions, there is recorded media that you can optionally view/listen if you need it. These are recorded from a student point of view (but carefully vetted by us), as you’ll see."

(That is, you can’t submit something three days late, and claim that you’ve used only part of the 4-day extension.) You do NOT need to tell us you are using an extension, we will merely apply the best fit in the order we get the submissions. You also cannot pick and choose which extension to apply.\nWe’re doing extensions ONLY because because everyone gets ill or has the occasional sudden emergency. It is NOT intended to be used as a tool for time-management or convenience.\nFor all other submissions where the extension does not apply, we will take off 25% per day late. These points taken off will NOT not be pro-rated hourly. Thus, if something is due 5pm March 19th, a submission at 5.05pm March 19th has 25% taken off.\nYou get bonus points if you don’t use any extensions at all and if you don’t submit anything late.\nIf you’re seeking an extension because you’ve been seriously ill and have a letter from a doctor, communicate with the TA.\nYou cannot use any extension resulting in a submission past the last due date."

Likewise, you may not look at anyone else’s code or show your code to anyone else.\nImportant: We have sophisticated tools that automatically examine all students’ code and that perform a comparison. These tools are very good at determining similarity in code. We also reserve the right to ask you probing questions about submitted work; failure to answer these questions may result in loss of points for the submitted work.\nImportant: Parts of the final exam will feature small variations of the assigned work but without electronic access to your computer. Thus, you will succeed in the exam only if you actually do the assigned work.\nIf you use material in your assignments that are from outside the course material, then you should be prepared to explain that material. The instructors and TAs reserve the right to question you on your use of any extraneous material. Failure to answer such questions might be viewed as grounds for an integrity violation.\nThe Academic Integrity Code will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully. Penalties for violating the code or the policies described here include failing this course.\nIf you have a disability that may effect your participation in this course and wish to discuss academic acommodations, please contact us as soon as possible."
